<p>Alexander looked stunned for some seconds of Mudd's rant.  He deactivated his holo projection.</p>
<p>Alexander’s disappearing hologram agitated Mudd even more.  “Hiding now!? Who’s the real coward!”</p>
<p>Alexander sat in his command chair and urgently fiddled with his console in order to connect with Sliter.  Slither’s hologram appeared–his sinister smile was gone and in its place was a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Alexander asked urgently.</p>
<p>“I cannot ascertain the specifics but it appears that elements of Mudd’s lower ranking team somehow surprised our agents–even though we took every precaution to prevent this scenario–in the ensuing struggle our agents were likely killed but possibly just subdued.  In my judgment we have lost control of Mudd’s flagship and cannot hope to retake it.”</p>
<p>“DAMMIT!”, Alexander exclaimed.  And he banished Slither’s hologram in a frustrated motion.</p>
<p>“Asymptote in 45 minutes–power continues to grow.” Fae-Dra interjected she seemed unphased by the recent reversal of fortunes. She was possibly not paying attention to the happenings at all as none of it involved her which is a common behavior of Androsynth: They ignore everything happening around them that isn’t directly related to their task.</p>
<p>Alexander made an expression of agitation yet made no response.  He was directly behind Fae-Dra and she couldn’t see his reaction and even if she had seen it she was quite inept when it came to understanding body language .  Alexander never scolded Fae-Dra for her faults.  Her tremendous strengths were too valuable to risk losing in a vain attempt to make her behavior more human.</p>
<p>He was staring at the floor, his mind racing with anxiety as he tried to quickly construct a plan B.  The avenues to many strategies were now closed… He had already hoodwinked his adversaries by leading them to believe he would surrender… His speech had been cut off right before he was going to inspire the Alliance men and women to join his banner–although he had the control codes they were not terribly useful without the loyalties of the flesh and blood assets.  His fleet was significantly smaller and not prepared for a battle.  Mudd’s ship was a massive capital ship that in order for the small Red Destiny to defeat would probably require a major blunder from Mudd.</p>
<p>Mudd was still yelling and threatening him.  His weapons were powered up and a visible blue shield barrier was flickering around the entire ship.</p>
<p>It looked bad, yet Alexander had a history of quickly pivoting to new strategies when things didn’t go as planned.  And a plan came to him.</p>
<p>He stood and reactivated his Holoprojector.  He showed complete confidence and zero fear as he interrupted Mudd’s rant.  Mudd listened probably in the hopes that whatever Alexander said would make him MORE mad.</p>
<p>“Commander Mudd!  I’m glad to see that you didn’t just hand over your fleet but instead decided to honor me with a worthy challenge.  I graciously accept!  I have made the claim that you are not worthy to lead the combined fleet and that my leadership would be more suitable.  From a certain point of view this conflict doesn’t involve our fleets at all but is really a conflict between two men.   So let’s treat it as such!  I formally challenge you to a duel!  I’ll even–”</p>
<p>Mudd had heard enough and interrupted: “Accepted!” His hologram disappeared and shortly after Alexander surmised that the discussion was over and deactivated his holoprojection as well.</p>
<p>This was a great development.  Alexander's skill in melee combat was renowned whereas there was no record of Mudd ever engaging in a man-to-man skirmish.  Alexander couldn’t believe Mudd agreed to his long shot.</p>
<p>Alexander relaxed in his chair then suddenly was caught off guard by what he saw on the main viewscreen.  A stream of energy cannon blasts from multiple origin points dotting Mudd’s ship and each stream would converge on The Red Destiny in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>However, No surprise attack imaginable could catch Fae-Dra off guard. She used the exceed engine to nearly instantaneously zip to a position still in front of–but now 15 degrees away from the centerpoint–Mudd’s flagship and a moment later the streams converged on empty space.</p>
<p>The Exceed Engine is what gave the companion class ship its agility and agility was essential to fulfilling the  companion class’s role.  The Exceed Engine performs property shifting on the ship and all its contents.  In an instant the Exceed Engine would reduce the mass of its ship to a micro fraction allowing for a substantial and nearly instant traversal when paired with a coordinated propulsion impulse.  The engine could only be engaged for a fraction of a second then its effect would be nullified causing the ship to resume its pre exceed velocity in an instant.  A major drawback to using exceed is that it also reduced the ship’s atomic cohesion when active which made the ship extremely fragile to the point where collision with a microscopic particle would most likely result in the catastrophic destruction of the ship.  Effectively using Exceed required beyond exceptional piloting skill.</p>
<p>“I was challenging him to a face-to-face duel!” Alexander exclaimed to Fae-Dra who gave the complaint no mind.</p>
<p>A new volley of bolts fired aimed towards The Red Destiny’s new position and like before Fae-Dra elegantly used Exceed to dodge.</p>
<p>Alexander accepted the situation and shifted back to strategizing mode.</p>
<p>His first action was to send a hasty communique to his fleet not to interfere in the battle.  As a matter of fact he made the communique public so that the Alliance fleet would see his command as well.  He knew that a total fleet engagement wouldn’t be good for anyone.</p>
<p>He issued his first order to Fae-Dra: “Sap him.”  Sapping was a strategy companion classes used in order to weaken a powerful reflective shield.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra immediately complied.  She used exceed to close range with the shield to mere centimeters; she then activated The Red Destiny’s Razon shields and boosted directly into the thick shield barrier.  The Red Destiny was deflected but not harmed and the total power of Mudd’s shield had been drained.  Immediately after deflection Fae-Dra used exceed to put a safe distance between the two ships.</p>
<p>The Razon Shields hovered mere millimeters away from the hull plating and wrapped the ship in a bright yellow glow.  Razons were not defensive in nature but instead reinforced the strength of the material they flowed over and annihilated a fraction of a millimeter of any materials that grazed the Razon’s externally facing side .  The Razon Shield’s were employed in two attack variants called Shearing or Sapping depending upon if material or energy was the target.  The maneuver was the linchpin of the companion class’s most common attack: it would literally slice through its adversary’s equipment, shearing through its materials and exiting on the other side.</p>
<p>When attacking an enemy object with a reflective shield the Razons would sap the shield barrier’s power forcing the enemy to replenish the loss with a non-trivial quantity of energy.  The sapping technique when repeated many times would eventually cause the object to exhaust its usable power to the point that it couldn’t maintain its shields and then the companion ship would finish the job with a Shearing attack.</p>
<p>Mudd replenished his shield’s loss as expected.  And he continued to wildly lob cannon blasts at The Red Destiny only for them to be dodged by Fae-Dra’s piloting.</p>
<p>At least Mudd seemed to agree that all out fleet war was inappropriate as he ordered his auxiliary capital ships to surround the battle zone and emit barrier shields which contained his erratic cannon blasts.   Well, it might have been a precaution to prevent collateral damage or it could have been to eliminate any chance of The Red Destiny’s escape.</p>
<p>“After Image”, Alexander instructed Fae.</p>
<p>The After Image technique created 32 very precise holographic representations of The Red Destiny that completely surrounded Mudd’s battleship.  Computer instrumentation could determine if an image was a hologram or not in a fraction of a second–but the second part of the technique rendered the computers completely confused.  Fae-Dra used exceed to rapidly replace a random hologram with the real Red Destiny.  And in a fraction of a second she would exceed again to another random hologram.  Additionally she would make the holograms change their positions in a random and unpredictable pattern.  Mudd could get a reliable lock to fire his cannons as each image was either a hologram or The Red Destiny’s momentary location.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra maintained a fury of After Image leaps yet would at some intervals invoke a Sapping attack.  The technique was working and Alexander could detect the severe taxation on Mudd’s available power–but he was behind schedule and had not determined how long the sapping would take.</p>
<p>Alexander tasked his computer with calculating the estimates and received an unwelcome result: It would take between 4 and 6 hours to completely sap the shields.  He wanted a half hour for the next phase of his plan which required reaching the Asymptote at a precise moment.</p>
<p>From his console he opened a hologram that displayed a searchable schematic of Mudd’s flagship.  He studied it very intently.</p>
<p>“Where is Pete when you need him…”  He lamented. And then had the horrible thought that his old friend might have been killed at this point.  He shook this thought and again directed  his complete concentration to finding a weakness in Mudd’s ship that could be exploited.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra continued her dodges and attacks showing no signs of fatigue.  Mudd tried a variety of techniques to get a lock or in some way to damage The Red Destiny but nothing came close to landing a hit.</p>
<p>Alexander's demeanor became increasingly agitated and showed no signs of approaching a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mudd stopped all its attacks and it began to back away.  Alexander did not once look at the viewscreen but to the side of his work he had a small tactical hologram of the situation.  Alexander directed Fae-Dra to cease the After Image technique as he was not sure what Mudd was up to.  He leaned in even further to the schematics he was studying as if he thought that would make him more perceptive.</p>
<p>As Mudd backed up the capital ship’s providing the enclosing shield approached Mudd’s ship.  Then the final strategy became clear: Mudd began charging up his main cannon.  A ball of energy was coalescing right before Mudd’s ship.</p>
<p>Alexander noticed what was happening a little late.   What he correctly surmised was that Mudd intended to fire a powerful and wide main cannon blast that would fill the entire shielded arena.  Mudd’s capital ships would be fine behind their deflection shields but everything inside the battle arena would have no safe space.</p>
<p>Alexander was quick to pivot when conditions changed.  Although the power core of The Red Destiny was now outputting many times more power than Mudd’s ship, none of his ship systems could handle that much power… well none of them except for the one that Alexander did not want to use.</p>
<p>Companion ship class ships rely on the exceed drive for defense and the Razon shields for offense but it had one more exceptional ability, its trump card if you will.   The Red Destiny had a main cannon of its own… and it was capable of accepting all of Tzo crystal’s energy output and even more.  The drawback of the main cannon was that it typically consumed all of The Red Destiny’s energy which would cause the Tzo crystal reactor to completely shut down leaving Alexander and Fae-Dra completely vulnerable.  The most important consideration when using a companion class’s main cannon was if the blast would be powerful enough to completely wipe out the enemy or if there were other assets in the fight that could defend the depleted ship until the battle was concluded.</p>
<p>In this case the conditions for using the Main Cannon were met.   The Tzo crystal could create a blast that would overwhelm Mudd’s blast and cause the complete obliteration of his ship.  But Alexander didn’t want to use the cannon this way.  First he had been building the energy of the Tzo crystal in order to conduct an immediate surprise attack on the Zell and secondly he dreaded the idea of killing his friend Pete who he convinced to surrender for his benefit only a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>He had to decide fast and since he hadn’t landed on any other options he really had no choice.</p>
<p>“Prepare to fire the main cannon, Fae”, Alexander reluctantly said.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra activated many subsystems through-out the ship.  The Red Destiny had to transform its shape before it could start the cannon build up and ultimate firing.</p>
<p>He turned off his console holograms with a heavy resignation about the decision he was just forced to make.  And for the first time he observed the view screen which displayed a close up of Mudd’s ship.  And… He saw something!</p>
<p>The Red Destiny was still making noises as parts rubbed together and servos whined in the service of transforming the ship to cannon mode.</p>
<p>Alexander entered a hearty laugh and slapped his lap several times.  “Cancel Main Cannon fire!” He said.  And Fae-Dra reversed the process.</p>
<p>“I’m such an idiot… if I had only turned off the tactical readouts earlier!”</p>
<p>Fae-Dra was clueless and uninterested in Alexander’s editorial mumbles.</p>
<p>“It seems our friend Mudd, in his haste to destroy us, forgot to close the hatch to the main hangar that he opened to invite us to our surrender.  Well, I say at this point we accept his invitation and show up in his hangar without delay!”</p>
<p>Alexander then gave Fae-Dra more specific instructions on what he had in mind.  And Fae-Dra and their ship was ready.</p>
<p>Mudd’s main cannon finished its build up phase and dropped his ship’s shields just a moment before unleashing his attack.  The Red Destiny seemed to make no effort to avoid its fate. The arena filled with blinding light.  It lasted for several seconds then began to fade.   And the audience saw… Nothing.   And there was a great pause as the Ronins, the Alliance and every soul aboard the Arks slowly processed the conclusion of a long struggle and what it meant.</p>
<p>Mudd celebrated immediately but was holding for a while to let the magnitude of the event sink in for everyone before he gave his final unifying speech.</p>
<p>The other capital ships solemnly deactivated their containment shields one by one.  The conflict was over and now the arena had to be torn down.</p>
<p>Then an event too shocking to believe completely disrupted the course of history.  The Bridge on top of Mudd’s ship burst open in a mighty explosion and from the wound a magnificent orange contrail grew at a speed that was imperceptible to the human eye.</p>
<p>The Ronin’s knew this contrail well: It was the contrails of a companion class ship.  The contrail zipped around performing several sharp zigzags and then suddenly coming to a complete stop…  The fading contrail led out of the freshly made gape of Mudd’s ship to … The Red Destiny!</p>
