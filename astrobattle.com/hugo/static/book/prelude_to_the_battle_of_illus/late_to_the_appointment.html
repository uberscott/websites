<p>Alexander walked down the hall of his command ship accompanied by a bevy of Tactical Engineers.  Fae*Dra kept pace silently by Alexander’s side.  He haggled with the officers over the logistics of surrendering at the appointed time.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t work like a Fusion or Antimatter core.  Power will build very slowly… it won’t even be powerful enough to propel your ship at the time you are asking–but give it time and you’ll have more power than you can handle.”</p>
<p>Alexander had blundered when agreeing upon a time to surrender.  He was having a special core installed in The Red Destiny and he miscalculated the time it would take to be ready.  A delay in the transfer of power might be greeted with unwanted hostility.</p>
<p>“We can install an antimatter core instead.” Another Tactical Engineer suggested.</p>
<p>“Not powerful enough…” Alexander squashed the idea.</p>
<p>Alexander and his entourage reached their destination: The quarters of Peter Dartanian Chief Tactical Engineer of the Ronin fleet and Alexander’s best friend.   Alexander had complete confidence that Pete would have just the innovation needed to keep his plan on track.</p>
<p>Outside Pete’s office Alexander was met by “Slither” who worked in the shadows as Alexander’s clandestine fixer.</p>
<p>Slither was short and slightly overweight.  He always wore reflective glasses to the point where Alexander had never seen his actual eyes.  His uniform was unique from the rest of the Ronins, it was quite plain with a sash and at his side was sheathed a small dagger.   Slither gave a sinister smile when he greeted Alexander as if he was delighted to carry out some fresh mischeif.</p>
<p>The door slid open and all entered the room. Pete was completely absorbed in a holographic battle plan and examined it up to the last possible moment before his attention was required to be turned over to the interlopers.  He then deactivated the simulation and examined the attendees.  Pete glanced at Slither and then his eyes returned to Alexander following the path of an upward bowing arc as if he was fighting the desire to roll his eyes.  Pete already knew very well the reason for this visit.</p>
<p>“How can we speed this up?”  Alexander posed a blunt question.</p>
<p>Pete was silent for a moment.  He understood the technology that drove the new core well and he genuinely entertained Alexander’s impossible request for a few moments.</p>
<p>“We could subject it to a large energy burst from another reactor just as we seed a fusion reaction sometimes…. The problem is that this drive is such new technology and we don’t have the data to simulate the outcome.  We would run a high risk of catastrophic destruction… with easily enough energy to obliterate the entire flotilla.”</p>
<p>The meeting progressed with several lesser Tactical Engineers posing a wide range of unproven options.  Pete carefully dismissed each proposal as impractical  or too dangerous to attempt.</p>
<p>“Our problem stems from the fact that no one has ever created a Tzo Crystal core this small… Many properties of how Tzo crystals behave are still unknown to us so we don’t have the tools required to simulate these proposals.”, Pete said with finality.</p>
<p>Pete resorted to a tried and true reminder from Tactical Engineers of old: “As you know I opposed this plan.  But since you are proceeding all I have left to say is that you need to treat the time it will take to build the core power as an immovable object and solve your problem some other way because a known safe solution does not exist within our knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Within our knowledge….” Alexander trailed off and seemed to bring his thoughts inward for a moment.</p>
<p>“Perhaps a more political approach can solve your problem.”  Slither said. Alexander broke with his ruminations and gave Slither his full attention.   Pete did not make eye contact with Slither, but instead directed his focus on his console screen returning to other matters that needed his attention.</p>
<p>“They are seeking symbolism.  What about the surrender of some other valued and high ranking officials?  It will show your commitment and buy time.  It will ease the tension as they wait for you.”  Slither proposed.</p>
<p>Alexander looked forward as this new idea worked its way through his mind.  “Yes!” he said and his inspirational nature swelled within him for the convincing he was about to undertake.</p>
<p>“Pete, my boy!” Alexander said loudly, causing Pete to jolt in his seat.  “It has to be YOU!”</p>
<p>“On second thought let’s go ahead and bombard the Tzo crystal with energy–I prefer instantaneous obliteration.” Pete retorted.</p>
<p>“It <em>has</em> to be you.  You are the only officer other than me that is well known by the Alliance.”</p>
<p>“No way”, Pete was firm.</p>
<p>“Give us a moment.” Alexander commanded.</p>
<p>All auxiliary participants shuffled out of Pete’s office except for Fae*Dra.   Slither gave Pete an acidic smile as he eclipsed the threshold.</p>
<p>The door shut.  A muffled and heated conversation could be heard by all outside.  Fifteen minutes later the door slid open and a resigned looking Pete began walking towards his ship in the hanger assembly.  His feet seemed to be trudging through molasses while his upper body was nudged along by the power of Alexander’s invisible will.</p>
