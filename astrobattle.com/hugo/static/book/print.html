<h2 id="a-ghastrals-offer"><a class="header" href="#a-ghastrals-offer">A Ghastral's Offer</a></h2>
<p>On a mangled and derelict ship wrecked in the aftermath of a violet space battle , A Ghastral sat on a man's chest.</p>
<p>"Alive? I doubt for much longer.",It gave a little snicker. Its body was plump and fused with the head. Its skin was warty and wet like a toad's and from it a pungent steam emanated. Its voice was raspy and unusually deep for a creature that could sit on a human's hand.</p>
<p>"I've just decided I can't hope to understand you." It spoke through a wide mouth filled with sharp, generously spaced teeth. It made no mitigation for a trickle of a black drool flowing over its bottom lip and chin.</p>
<p>The man coughed and tears escaped his eyes.</p>
<p>"I warned you of this ending..."</p>
<p>The creature bobbed up and down as the man heaved by way of sobbing.</p>
<p>"...and it makes me sad to see you this way..."</p>
<p>A sadistic grin grew on the tiny monster.</p>
<p>"... Broken and humiliated by he... he who is not worthy..."</p>
<p>The grin grew to an absurdity.</p>
<p>"He who has stolen all from you and he who has made it his own...", it trailed off into a slow and rumbling snicker.</p>
<p>The grin eased and the creature became more puffed and reddish. More steam escaped from its body. It held a tiny crystal that glowed with a color never before seen by man... a dark hue. It shoved the crystal before the man's face.</p>
<p>"And Still You Reject the power to make things right... you reject my little
trinket. Tisk task, my human."</p>
<p>The man gritted his teeth... The eyes of the little menace began to glow like red
embers.</p>
<p>"there really isn't a case for further moralization. He's brought you low. At the
point of death... now all that's left is the word. so say it. just say it."</p>
<p>The man forced his mouth shut.</p>
<p>"Say the word, my human. Say it. I can't stand to see you in anguish for another
moment. Please. say it. And all this will go away. Say it. I beg you to say it"</p>
<p>Tremors broke over the man's body. The little terror's sickly smile eased back
into existence.</p>
<p>"Why do you protest at this late hour? I have told you of the other human we
Ghastrals court. He is so very close to saying the word...so very close... you
know I know this And once one human says the word I am afraid our masters
lose interest in all other candidates. Don't let me lose all the work I have put
into you to my rival. Think of me! Think of me and say the word"</p>
<p>With little strength the man put his hand over his mouth and clenched his eyes
shut.</p>
<p>"Say it now or accept the injustice forever!", it shouted:" NOW SAY IT! "</p>
<p>The determined abomination hopped on the man's face and peeled his
eyelids open. Its own pupils were now red rings that slowly expanded beyond
the blacks of his entire eye to be replaced by another growing ring in its center
and another and another....</p>
<p>"The moment is nigh, human... he will take it from you! . SAY IT! SAY IT
NOW!!!!!!!!"</p>
<p>Suddenly the man violently writhed and spoke three syllables: "ASC-EN-
TION!!!"</p>
<p>The Ghastral's grin grew so wide it looked to split his ace in two.
A hot batch of steam exploded enveloping the creature and the man. The
cloud seemed lit within with the dark hue from the crystal which now shown
'brighter' than ever.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! YES! You Have done it! and Just in time. I knew it would be
you. You will now be made into something beyond HIM my human! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
The smoke cleared and where they had gone no one can tell.</p>

<p>“It is <strong>over</strong>. You are <strong>done</strong>.”, A holographic of Supreme Commander Mudd asserted with finality.</p>
<p>At least a dozen other politicians, lesser officers and bureaucrats surrounded Mudd’s formed a  holographic chorus of baddies. All concurred with Mudd.  All with fight or flight mechanisms strung to near breaking.</p>
<p>Alexander Holmes adopted a stoic demeanor for a moment as he sized up his flickering haters in his darkened ready room and then slumped forward slightly as if his body had finally accepted a defeat.</p>
<p>“Surrender now and we will treat you and those you have recklessly lead to hell with fairness and dignity.” A  politician added – presumably an important one.</p>
<p>The stakes of this meeting were quite high as the Human race was presently engaged in two wars.</p>
<p>The first war was between the Humans and a nasty species called the Zell.</p>
<p>The second war was waged between two factions within the human race.  So far the conflict had been purely political in nature yet it had teetered at times on the verge of violence.   Circumstances had produced two completely independent fleets that battled the Zell.  There was the Alliance Fleet which was under Supreme Commander James Mudd who in turn answered to the politicians empowered by the democratic structures of three large human populations. And the other was the Ronin Fleet whose loyalties fell to Alexander Holmes.</p>
<p>The cause of the multi-fleet situation was rooted in what the Zell had done, which requires some explanation:</p>
<p>The Zell were creatures that had no redeeming qualities.  They were everything bad: violent, nasty and sadistic. Life -- even their own lives--held no importance to the Zell.  A small number of elite Zell were formidable  warriors, but most individual Zell known as the Rabble were no match for the average warbot or human soldier.  Zell would not be scary at all if they didn’t exist in such massive numbers.  Countless Zell cruised the galactic sectors engaging in their favorite pastime of warmongering with the Humans… As a matter of fact the Zell ONLY seemed to hate the Human species and ignored all others.</p>
<p>Humans had been forced to abandon their homeworld of Earth more than a thousand years before they encountered the Zell in a completely unrelated conflict. And after humans became space faring nomads for a while they flourished in unexpected ways.  Humans thrived for hundreds of years, developing technology for faster than light travel and spreading and befriending many diverse species in their sector of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Before the Zell the local galactic neighborhood was sparsely populated with Human colonies and settlements. The overwhelming bulk of humans were clustered among seven mega populations – each containing many billions of inhabitants and each an independent sovereignty with a fleet of ships for defense.  Four of these populations were traditional planets and three more were giant space Arks–human constructions that housed billions of tenants.</p>
<p>The initial Zell blitzkrieg eight years prior took the human race completely by surprise.  The many Minor Colonies and Settlements were immediately wiped out.  And the planetary civilizations fell within the first two years of the war.  In space combat stationary assets are exceptionally challenging to protect.</p>
<p>The Arks had survived by virtue of their mobility.   In the three years before the battle of Ilus the  location of the Arks was unknown to the Zell.   But that had just changed.   On the other side of the Rift of Ilus a Zell fleet waited. An uncountable number of Zell reinforcements approached from many directions.  In two days the entire human race would be completely surrounded.  Battle projections – which normally varied between outcomes of victory or defeat – seemed to be in rare agreement that the human race was doomed and only differed in predicting how long the defeat would take (with ranges between several hours to several minutes.)</p>
<p>The Alliance fleet was vast.  It was composed of the fleets from the only intact governments from the remaining three Arks.  In the middle portion of the war the Alliance fleet had barely held its own against the Zell.  After experiencing significant losses in a battle three years prior the Alliance fleet adopted a purely defensive posture choosing to protect the Arks forsaking attack.</p>
<p>By contrast The Ronin fleet was small – about one fourth the size of the Alliance fleet.  Unlike the Alliance, Ronins were not the lap dogs of any government yet had formed in the absence of political influence.   The fleet had grown over the years by annexing military remnants once bound to the now gone planetary sovereignties and included dislodged warships, scientists, engineers, space factories and all the resources to facilitate a respected war machine.</p>
<p>Alexander was the leader of the Ronins… actually he WAS the Ronin fleet.  The Fleet existed because of his brashness, his charisma, his magnetic leaderships, his vision, his ambition and his uncanny ability to produce victories from seemingly impossible scenarios.  He spread hope to the disenfranchised elements that had lost their homeworlds speech by speech, stirring them to a greater cause… making them part of the effort that would not only save the human race but actually defeat the Zell.</p>
<p>The central difference in doctrine that set the two fleets apart:  The Alliance meant to merely survive the Zell while the Ronins meant to completely destroy them.  Most believed fleet unification was prerequisite to achieving either goal therefore the dire situation of the Zell’s encroachment created great urgency for unification.</p>
<p>Back to the tense meeting: In a resigned fashion Alexander delivered the climactic proclamation:  “I will come to you in ‘The Red Destiny’ for the surrender six hours from now,"  The Red Destiny was Alexander’s attack ship and its exploits were somewhat famous, known to humans and Zell alike.  The offer was irresistible to Mudd and his counterparts would soon be taking custody of the very symbol of the Ronin fleet.</p>
<p>“AND you will make a speech.  A unifying speech announcing that your fleet will be peacefully folded into the Alliance under Commander Mudd.” A Second politician inserted.</p>
<p>Surrender wasn’t enough… for everything Alexander had put them through the only remedy was public humiliation.</p>
<p>Alexander shut his eyes, tilted his head slightly backwards and inhaled as if he accepted poison into his body and said “I will make a speech.”</p>
<p>The holograms seemed satisfied and they faded away like ghosts that had fulfilled their earthly purpose and now had only to be whisked away to the afterlife.</p>
<p>The light intensity of the room slowly increased.  Alexander’s posture shed all signs of duress and he began reviewing strategic plans on his console.</p>
<p>On a sofa off to the side of the room sat a small girl previously shrouded by the darkness. She stared into space with her silvery eyes. She had shoulder length white hair and her skin was like porcelain with slightly rosy cheeks. One would judge her to be about nine-years-old although she was actually quite older.  Some that witnessed her would be bothered by a certain indescribable artifice about her and this was because she was not just a human but actually a very special type of cyborg known as an Androsynth.   Her name was Fae*Dra and she was Alexander’s constant companion and partner in his many mayhems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="safety-is-just-a-fold-away"><a class="header" href="#safety-is-just-a-fold-away">SAFETY IS JUST A FOLD AWAY</a></h1>
<p>Mudd sank in his chair as if stress that had kept him inflated for years just escaped his body.  Then he stiffened again and stood.  He faced the sofa.  <em>“See!?”</em> he said with great agitation.   No one else was in the room.</p>
<p>Mudd was 60-years-old graying with crusty mustache and sporting a uniform with many vanity adornments: metals and other recognitions of accomplishments.</p>
<p>The anxiety level was elevated but not to the point of panic.   The Humans had been in similar spots before and had eluded the Zell by virtue of a very recent discovery: The Fold Drive – a technology the Zell lacked.</p>
<p>The Alliance had installed massive fold drives in each of the three Arks.  The fold aperture could be made large enough to transport many companion vessels, enough to send a convoy with the Arks through a fold in space.</p>
<p>The general populace knew that in a matter of hours the entire human race would be enveloped in a magnificent fold bubble, travel through a bright and chaotic interdimensional tunnel and then reemerge in this universe millions of lightyears away. They knew it would take the Zell years to find them again.</p>
<p>Fold drives were scarce, not because the technology required to create them was cutting edge, but because the heart of every fold drive was enabled by something very rare known as a Tzo crystal. Tzo crystals are precursor artifacts that had been discovered some fifty years prior to the battle of Ilus.  It was only one year prior to the attack of the Zell that scientist had discovered that by subjecting a Tzo crystal to the right energy frequencies it could be coaxed into opening an entry aperture in one point in our universe which tunneled to an exit aperture many millions of lightyears away enabling matter to be moved great distances over a time span that was negligible.</p>
<p>In the fifty years since the Tzo crystal’s discovery only eight had been found and only three of those were adequate for generating folds large enough to move the entire fleet.</p>
<p>It was safe passage via the Ark folds that Mudd had leveraged in order to force Alexander’s surrender.  Mudd held the access keys to all three fold Arks on his person at all times and was in complete control of Human-kinds ability to fold space at the moment.</p>
<p>With Zell encroaching from every angle, folding was the only escape.  Mudd had forced Alexander’s hand by denying his Ronin fleet safe passage unless he finally surrendered.<br />
Mudd pressed a button and gave orders.  “Prepare for the Ronin’s surrender.  The Red Destiny will be processed by ‘The Hand of God’  All other ships will receive skeleton command structures from the Alliance until we know who can be trusted.”   “The Hand of God” was Mudd’s flagship.  It was a very large capital ship with a powerful main cannon.</p>
<p>The surrender would be very ceremonial which Mudd felt was prerequisite in order for the Ronin’s to accept the change and the populace of the Arks to feel at ease.  Ceremony was required in order for all to digest the change and the way things would be moving forward.  And as mentioned it was of great personal import that Mudd humiliate Alexander in the process for years of personal hurts.</p>
<p><em>“That technology is mine now”,</em> Mudd said to an empty sofa.   He was referring to the many innovations the Ronin’s had made to best the Zell… although the Ronin’s were much smaller they were far more innovative and the benefits of that innovation was now in Mudd’s hands.</p>
<p>He paced in his office speaking to himself pensively.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="late-to-the-appointment"><a class="header" href="#late-to-the-appointment">LATE TO THE APPOINTMENT</a></h2>
<p>Alexander walked down the hall of his command ship accompanied by a bevy of Tactical Engineers.  Fae*Dra kept pace silently by Alexander’s side.  He haggled with the officers over the logistics of surrendering at the appointed time.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t work like a Fusion or Antimatter core.  Power will build very slowly… it won’t even be powerful enough to propel your ship at the time you are asking–but give it time and you’ll have more power than you can handle.”</p>
<p>Alexander had blundered when agreeing upon a time to surrender.  He was having a special core installed in The Red Destiny and he miscalculated the time it would take to be ready.  A delay in the transfer of power might be greeted with unwanted hostility.</p>
<p>“We can install an antimatter core instead.” Another Tactical Engineer suggested.</p>
<p>“Not powerful enough…” Alexander squashed the idea.</p>
<p>Alexander and his entourage reached their destination: The quarters of Peter Dartanian Chief Tactical Engineer of the Ronin fleet and Alexander’s best friend.   Alexander had complete confidence that Pete would have just the innovation needed to keep his plan on track.</p>
<p>Outside Pete’s office Alexander was met by “Slither” who worked in the shadows as Alexander’s clandestine fixer.</p>
<p>Slither was short and slightly overweight.  He always wore reflective glasses to the point where Alexander had never seen his actual eyes.  His uniform was unique from the rest of the Ronins, it was quite plain with a sash and at his side was sheathed a small dagger.   Slither gave a sinister smile when he greeted Alexander as if he was delighted to carry out some fresh mischeif.</p>
<p>The door slid open and all entered the room. Pete was completely absorbed in a holographic battle plan and examined it up to the last possible moment before his attention was required to be turned over to the interlopers.  He then deactivated the simulation and examined the attendees.  Pete glanced at Slither and then his eyes returned to Alexander following the path of an upward bowing arc as if he was fighting the desire to roll his eyes.  Pete already knew very well the reason for this visit.</p>
<p>“How can we speed this up?”  Alexander posed a blunt question.</p>
<p>Pete was silent for a moment.  He understood the technology that drove the new core well and he genuinely entertained Alexander’s impossible request for a few moments.</p>
<p>“We could subject it to a large energy burst from another reactor just as we seed a fusion reaction sometimes…. The problem is that this drive is such new technology and we don’t have the data to simulate the outcome.  We would run a high risk of catastrophic destruction… with easily enough energy to obliterate the entire flotilla.”</p>
<p>The meeting progressed with several lesser Tactical Engineers posing a wide range of unproven options.  Pete carefully dismissed each proposal as impractical  or too dangerous to attempt.</p>
<p>“Our problem stems from the fact that no one has ever created a Tzo Crystal core this small… Many properties of how Tzo crystals behave are still unknown to us so we don’t have the tools required to simulate these proposals.”, Pete said with finality.</p>
<p>Pete resorted to a tried and true reminder from Tactical Engineers of old: “As you know I opposed this plan.  But since you are proceeding all I have left to say is that you need to treat the time it will take to build the core power as an immovable object and solve your problem some other way because a known safe solution does not exist within our knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Within our knowledge….” Alexander trailed off and seemed to bring his thoughts inward for a moment.</p>
<p>“Perhaps a more political approach can solve your problem.”  Slither said. Alexander broke with his ruminations and gave Slither his full attention.   Pete did not make eye contact with Slither, but instead directed his focus on his console screen returning to other matters that needed his attention.</p>
<p>“They are seeking symbolism.  What about the surrender of some other valued and high ranking officials?  It will show your commitment and buy time.  It will ease the tension as they wait for you.”  Slither proposed.</p>
<p>Alexander looked forward as this new idea worked its way through his mind.  “Yes!” he said and his inspirational nature swelled within him for the convincing he was about to undertake.</p>
<p>“Pete, my boy!” Alexander said loudly, causing Pete to jolt in his seat.  “It has to be YOU!”</p>
<p>“On second thought let’s go ahead and bombard the Tzo crystal with energy–I prefer instantaneous obliteration.” Pete retorted.</p>
<p>“It <em>has</em> to be you.  You are the only officer other than me that is well known by the Alliance.”</p>
<p>“No way”, Pete was firm.</p>
<p>“Give us a moment.” Alexander commanded.</p>
<p>All auxiliary participants shuffled out of Pete’s office except for Fae*Dra.   Slither gave Pete an acidic smile as he eclipsed the threshold.</p>
<p>The door shut.  A muffled and heated conversation could be heard by all outside.  Fifteen minutes later the door slid open and a resigned looking Pete began walking towards his ship in the hanger assembly.  His feet seemed to be trudging through molasses while his upper body was nudged along by the power of Alexander’s invisible will.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="one-lester-man"><a class="header" href="#one-lester-man">ONE LESTER MAN</a></h1>
<p>Far from peril a seemingly insignificant vessel lay nested in the support flotilla.</p>
<p>The support flotilla is thousands of spacecraft that attach themselves and join their innards into a giant, unwieldy and most ugly wonder of engineering.  Power and fluids are shared between the flotilla members via obvious cables and pipes, but what truly makes the Flotilla special is the conveyance tubes which allow efficient transfer of men and materials.  In this way the specialties of each ship contribute to one giant support superstructure. The Flotilla is a mobile home base if you will.  Of course significant time and effort is needed to assemble (or disassemble) such a monstrosity and when combined mobility is entirely compromised.</p>
<p>The support flotilla was decked with hangars, repair bays, vaults, barracks, officer quarters, mess halls, science stations and everything else imaginable.  It was a temporary floating main base for the Ronin fleet and its capture or destruction by the enemy would mean total collapse of the Ronnins.  It was ALSO the headquarters of the Tactical Engineering Support team which was housed in the ‘seemingly insignificant’ and clunky piece of junk vessel mentioned christened ‘Vulkan’s Pride.’</p>
<p>The ‘seemingly’ differentiator is an essential adjective because Tactical Engineers were vital to Astro Battle… No major battle in space had been won without smart use of these battlefield wizards. They are more smart than strong. They applied their arcane knowledge of science, technology, mathematics and engineering to give their battlefield betters an advantage critical for victory.  And unlike other engineers, all Tactical Engineers (or TacEng as they were oft called) Every TacEng was a fast and decisive thinker and doer.</p>
<p>Among them are two distinct and different varieties.  The Field  TacEng (Fieldies) who are obedient to command and proud to stand among the hardened warriors on the front lines.  Fieldies were not averse to extreme risk or personal hazard or engaging in actual hand to hand combat.  They had the respect of everyone in the war machine.</p>
<p>Then there are the TacEng Support engineers (or Supporties.) who were unalike in that they were more fat than fit, more opinionated than compliant. The Supporties are the bane of command and–if not for their extreme utility–top brass would have turned the implements of war towards the ‘Vulkan’s Pride’ to obliterate its crew of headache-inducing know-it-alls–sharper headaches than the enemy themselves…</p>
<p>And one other thing, when it was wrote a paragraph ago that ‘Fieldies’ had “the respect of everyone in the war machine”  It would have been more accurate to say “...Almost everyone in the war machine” for the Supporties were indeed smarter than the Fieldies and within the Support TacEng ranks brains are lauded more than anything.  To be more direct: The two cousin species of Tactical Engineers do not like each other.  More granularly, the Fieldies hate the Supporties and the Supporties don’t care what any thought of them.</p>
<pre><code>At the moment condition lights and periodic public announcements were rousing the sedentary support staff to a state where they could fulfill their battle-time duties.  There had been a complete information blackout on the flotilla–especially censored was the news of Alexander’s struggles with the main fleet which had been under a strict information blackout… no one on the Vulkan’s Pride knew what was next however a feeling pervaded the flotilla: A major battle was imminent and soon to unfold.

Aboard the Vulkan’s Pride Massive lines of Tactical Engineers flowed and flexed into the Danger room like tiny particles in a stream each driving to his destination against the friction and backpressure of the crowd.  The Danager room is a vast cubical farm where the support Support Engineers conduct live operations.  Although in look each cube station was nothing cube-like, but more like a negative hemisphere, each decorated with a lovely fattened tactical engineer in the center and the accommodation was small… Tactical Engineering stations were less entered and more worn.
</code></pre>
<p>Among those people particles entering the hall one Lester Mann surfed the starts and stops reluctantly homing in to his destination.  He was–as all are in those momements–lost in thought.  Scenes of the past and dreams of the future played in his mind a collage of trauma, regrets, triumphs and goals just as any who share the human experience reviewing and renewing how he thought of himself, others and the things that made him who he was at that very moment.</p>
<p>He remembered something and  made a sudden pivot. His request to move his station had been approved so now he oriented towards the promised land and proceeded forward.</p>
<p>Then the dream ended. He saw something.  “Ed Greely”, he said acidicly and under his breath. And indeed, settling into an adjacent station was one Edward Greely – the very reason Lester had requested transfer..</p>
<p>Edward was not alone but surrounded by a cadre of cadets–trainies and future Tactical Engineers not recognized by Lester.</p>
<p>“Here he is!” Ed barked excitedly.  “He’s the one! Less! Hey, you moved.  Don’t worry, I told Gage we always sit together.”</p>
<p>He extended his index finger and pointed in a semicircle: “Meet the guys!”</p>
<p>He then slunk into the ‘promise land’ with all the excitement of diving into a hellhole.</p>
<p>“Here we got Grey, Jet and Rodgie” … He leaned forward and spoke quieter but still loud enough for everyone in the hall to hear,” Rodgie’s my favorite, but Greys got the best eyes for spotting things! What fun!  I’m the new ambassador to the cadets here as you know…”</p>
<p>Some sort of smile facsimile cracked on Lester’s hardened face.  He slunk into his station and activated his terminal… he was immediately surrounded by holographic interfaces, but not cloaked to an extent that he couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>“Mr Holmes!” Jet blurted.  Ed launched his right hand in placation of Jet and Less. “Lester <em>Mann</em> not Lester Holmes”, Ed corrected.  “You can just call him <em>Less</em>.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, <em>Mr. Greely</em>”, Jet said sheepishly.  Lester’s head ticked up a few angles and he stared straight forward and into nothing for a moment with unusually wide eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s fine!”, Ed continued, “Everyone makes mistakes.  LEss is the shimmer guy! Didn’t I tell you Less and I  invented the shimmer”</p>
<p>“The one that commander Alexander uses!”, Grey spouted.</p>
<p>“Now don’t make ole Less cranky, Grey Less is modest and his brother doesn’t like him too…Did I tell you guys Less and I have been best friends since High school?” The cadre nodded out of sequence.</p>
<p>“We’re like family! All of us!”</p>
<p>Rodgie pushed his head through the plane of holographic interfaces protecting Less making his question impossible to ignore: “Mr. Less, I’m a fan of your innovations in regards to nanobots.  In particular your creation of the shimmer effect.  I was wondering if you can explain exactly how that works.”</p>
<p>“Ha! That’s my Rodgie! Yer gonna love these guys, Less.”</p>
<p>Less sat back in his chair and dimmed his console in surrender.  That and it was actually a good question from Rodgie.</p>
<p>“Well, the bots are released into space and diffuse like a gas.  Because they hold a slight attraction to each other they can maintain a cloud shape in a vacuum.  Each bot is capable of attracting and repulsing a tiny amount of electromagnetic energy… i.e. light  the sheer volume of bots makes this effect multiplicative to the extreme.</p>
<p>“ The oscillating perturbation of energy plus the random motion and orientation of the bots disturbs the flow of light to such an extent the image of anything behind the shimmer from the observer's perspective into pure chaos. The observer can see there is something there, but cannot determine what it is or what it is doing.”</p>
<p>“But why can WE see what is on the other side of the Shimmer!”, Rodgie Asked.</p>
<p>“I thought only I could see on account of I got such good eyes”, Jett inserted.</p>
<p>“So Smart!  —” Ed continued to dote but Less cut him off:</p>
<p>“The bots broadcast their positions and oscillate in a random but predetermined pattern.  We are able to reverse calculate the perturbations and generate a reasonable facsimile of what is on the other side.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you are my favorite, Rodgie!” Now Ed wasn't even trying to be subtle.</p>
<p>A klaxon sounded.  All the Tactical Engineers scurried to their assigned positions.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Peter Dartanian appeared as a giant lifeless hologram in front of all and started to deliver a briefing.  There was talk about the Zell… breaching the Zell line…. Some sort of big explosion…. As the talk went on Lester became incapable of listening.</p>
<p>It was time for Lester to engage his greatest super power… he activated his cybernetic implants and sank deep into his dreamworld while at the same time activating a subroutine that kept his body upright and eyes open.   His super power was essentially the ability to sleep through meetings without anyone noticing.  The human race was sure to be saved by this fellow.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="chapter-4-disembarkation"><a class="header" href="#chapter-4-disembarkation">CHAPTER 4: DISEMBARKATION</a></h2>
<p>Alexander and Fae*Dra emerged from a conveyance tube and entered section 14B of hangar A in the Ronin’s flagship carrier.</p>
<p>The carrier was presently connected to hundreds of other support vessels via a vast network of conveyance tubes.   The Ronins called this massive ugly conglomeration of heterogeneous ships “The Flotilla” and  it facilitated efficient transfer of crew and materials.   The configuration made it extremely efficient to build and repair things, but once mobility was required the super structure would require a lengthy disassembly then component ships could travel as a convoy.</p>
<p>Alexander stared thoughtfully at his ship The Red Destiny as engineering bots scurried around making adjustments and final touches for flight readiness. He was decked head to toe in red battle armor and wore a short cape that was dark red on the outside contrasted by a brighter red on the interior side.  The cape was merely for show.  Red was Alexander’s color and the enemy knew that any red battle piece was in some way directly associated with Alexander Holmes.</p>
<p>Beside Alexander stood Fae*Dra clad in black armor.   She also starred forward at the commotion surrounding The Red Destiny and seemed to be in a trance.</p>
<p>Fae*Dra was the pilot of The Red Destiny and as mentioned before an Androsynth.
Alexander gave a protected glance toward Fae*Dra. She was his most important strategic asset and his new best friend</p>
<p>The second strategic asset and previous best friend was currently being lost to Mudd.  Alexander activated a vid feed and saw Pete being dragged into Mudd’s flagship under protection of guard with Mudd making a great show of how the Ronnin’s fleet Tactical Engineering team was now impotent.  There seemed to be a little acid in the presentation because of the public knowledge that Pete and Alexander were best of friends (were best friends, but the public didn’t know much about Fae*Dra).   Alexander turned off the vid feed angrily.  “Just wait Pete.  I will not forget you”</p>
<h4 id="a-special-delivery"><a class="header" href="#a-special-delivery">A Special Delivery</a></h4>
<p>The conveyance delivered a massive apparatus to the hangar.  It was a large unwieldy glob of technology that seemed shoddily put together.  Pipes, drooping cables and various components ran all over its exterior like ill considered greeble.  It seemed to have two large main components that shared all kinds of temporary interconnections.</p>
<p>The Engineering bots tending to the Red Destiny shuffled into an orderly formation as if to greet the apparatus like a guest of honor.   The apparatus came to a rest beside The Red Destiny.</p>
<p>A large panel that covered the bulk of the center portion of the Red Destiny was detached by a few quick moving bots and a giant mechanical arm that was a permanent fixture of the hanger lifted the panel away from the workspace.   The fresh opening revealed a large cavity right where one would expect to see a main component.</p>
<p>Bots rapidly swarmed over the apparatus detaching pipes and cables.  After a good deal of loose parts had been removed one of the larger components began to open like a clamshell to reveal the payload: It was the core reactor for the Red Destiny.  Unlike the apparatus which seemed in every way to be temporary and hastily, the core was very clean looking with very few fiddly bits adorning its exterior.  It looked as if it had been solidly engineered to the highest degree. The apparatus had supplied the core with all the plumbing required to operate as if it was in an actual ship.  It also fed the core its ignition energy building to a point where the reactor could sustain itself.</p>
<p>The core seemed to hum with power even though it was at that time operating at a mere fraction of its total capable output.</p>
<p>More bots joined the effort and began transferring connections from the apparatus to the internals of The Red Destiny.  And then a large fixed robot arm lowered the fresh core into the ship.   The Bots bolted the reactor in place.  Finally the panel was reattached completing The Red Destiny’s maintenance.</p>
<p>The Red Destiny came to life now that power was flowing through it.  All over the ship various lights activated and actuation surfaces started going through range-of-motion diagnostics.</p>
<p>Fae*Dra seemed to spring to life too. A focused posture rippled through her body.  It was not a coincidence–her mind was directly linked to The Red Destiny and a tremendous flow of telemetry was now being exchanged.</p>
<p>“Asymptote in 2 hours then 5 minutes till critical”, She said.   Alexander glanced as if to say “message received.”</p>
<p>They approached the ship which was suspended several meters above their heads.  The ventral portal opened and a light from the ship pulled them up into the air and into the ship.</p>
<p>The Red Destiny was a Companion class ship.  The Companion class was designed by the Ronin engineering team with technology that had no rival in the entire human fleet.  Its role was penetration of enemy lines by virtue of superior agility in order to deliver a main cannon blast right where the opposition was most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The two assumed their positions in the cramped bridge of The Red Destiny.   They were the only ones to board the ship even though the Companion class usually featured stations for seven crew members.</p>
<p>Fae*Dra sat in a chair positioned towards the forward area of the bridge where two pilots normally sat.  The unique configuration of the Red Destiny had only one  piloting station centered along the width of the ship.  Fae*Dra’s custom setup featured an uncharacteristically minimalist console.</p>
<p>Alexander took the captain’s chair directly behind Fae*Dra yet elevated a bit.  The entire floor of the bridge was raked at a minor angle in order to give aftward crew positions a view that wasn’t partially blocked by their more forwardly located colleagues.  Four additional stations flanked the captain’s center aisle with consoles that surrounded the occupants almost completely–for this mission those stations would be unmanned.</p>
<p>The Bridge was enveloped in a holo projecting screen that conformed to the walls and ceiling and in some cases the floor.  When the ship was underway the holo-projector screen provided total situational immersion – it was as if the majority of the bridge’s surfaces was completely invisible giving the occupants a 360 degree situational view.</p>
<p>The vessel gave off a growing symphony of unique hums as Fae*Dra began to supply power to various ship systems.  Several systems produced a sort of wind up sound as they drew increasing amounts of power–finally reaching a stable hum when operational parameters were achieved.</p>
<p>The reactor’s power output was quite lean at the moment which necessitated Fae*Dra to adopt an extremely strategic boot up procedure favoring only the essential components needed at the moment and supplying those components with only enough power for them to be adequately effective.</p>
<h4 id="alexanders-trump-card"><a class="header" href="#alexanders-trump-card">Alexander’s Trump Card</a></h4>
<p>A companion class ship was typically fitted with a Fusion Core Reactor and sometimes a far more powerful Anti-Matter Core reactor… but this time The Red Destiny’s source was  something that had never been attempted before in such a small ship – A Tzo Crystal reactor core.</p>
<p>Unknown to the Alliance Alexander had acquired a Tzo crystal.  It was small – about the size of a grain of sand – and it had an imperfect yellow coloring.  It was a wimp compared to the Tzo crystals in the Arks which were about 4-6 Carrots in size and crystal clear.</p>
<p>Although the Ronin engineers had worked towards creating a fold drive for The Red Destiny they fell short of the goal and landed upon a simpler core reactor solution for the interim.   The Tzo crystal was coaxed into accessing a second dimension where the laws of physics differed from our own.  In this second dimension vacuums produced energy instead of stars.  A Tzo crystal could pull the natural abundant energy through a portal.  Significantly the portal apertures for our dimension and the second dimension did not have to be the same size.  The reactor worked by creating a tiny aperture in our dimension while expanding the aperture of the second dimension to many hundreds of thousands of kilometers in order to harvest the dilute power produced by the vacuum.  The energy would concentrate as it traveled through a narrowing portal and exit into the reactor chamber via the microscopic aperture that existed in our dimension.</p>
<p>The majority of the power outflow was used to grow the second aperture increasing the total reactor yield.  The second largest quantity of power was consumed by the core’s containment mechanism which basically prevented the reactor from exploding. A small fraction of the total power energized the main bus which fed various components throughout the ship.</p>
<p>The core’s output would grow to an over abundance of available energy in the next half hour.  Alexander meant to deliberately push the Tzo Crystal reaction to “The Asymptote” – which was the point at which the power would scale at an exponential rate.  Once the Asymptote is reached the core cannot be shut down.  From that moment the core containment mechanisms- will have five minutes before they are overwhelmed resulting in a catastrophic explosion that would consume the ship and anything else within five-thousand kilometers… that is unless the reactor core could be vented in some way.</p>
<p>Alexander carefully regarded a news feed that was playing on one of his screens. The feed played background video of Pete exiting his ship in the hangar of  Mudd’s flagship while some talking pundits effortlessly came to agreement that the Ronin fleet was more or less impotent now that it was stripped of its Chief Tactical Engineer.</p>
<p>“Ready, Fae?” Alexander asked.</p>
<p>“Affirm, Alex!”, Fae responded.</p>
<p>Alexander hit a switch that opened a Ronin communication channel.  Several holographic images appeared suddenly in front of him including the visage of Slither.   “Commence.” Alexander said and a chorus of “Rogers” rang out from the virtual gathering.  He turned the channel off and the holographic personages rapidly faded away.</p>
<p>The hangar hatch started to open exposing its contents to the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>“Disembark.” Alexander commanded.</p>
<p>“Roger, Dis-bark.” responded Fae while simultaneously putting the ship into a gentle motion exiting the hangar.</p>
<p>Alexander activated a political feed.  Vid screens everywhere there were humans broadcasting the impending unification.  Pundits showered Admiral Mudd and Politicians alike with unanimous praise and relished Alexander’s satisfying downfall.  Alexander snickered.</p>
<h4 id="the-red-destiny"><a class="header" href="#the-red-destiny">The Red Destiny</a></h4>
<p>Ronin escorts began to join The Red Destiny in its procession to Mudd’s flagship.</p>
<p>Alexander switched on the comm channel, “Fly more like its a funeral dirge."  Fae fluttered and The Red Destiny suddenly lost its confidence.  “How fly a dirge?” she panicked.  “Yikes! Not you, Fae.” The ship and pilot's confidence was restored.</p>
<p>The Red Destiny was a companion class fighter.  Companion class had three stand out features: unrivaled agility, razon shields that could pierce through the toughest of materials and a main beam cannon that was exceptionally powerful for the size of the ship.  Outmaneuvering the enemy, slicing through his defences and dealing a deathblow to his vulnerable spot was the role that made the companion class a winner in astro battle.</p>
<p>Superior Agility was achieved via the Exceed engine which allowed the ship to temporarily break Newton's laws of physics. It allowed instant displacement of a short distance with no apparent acceleration  or deceleration.  The exceed engine aboard the Calvaries had a maximum range of 500 meters, it could be used several times a second though the engine had an overall constraint that was a complicated product of jump size and frequency over time.</p>
<p>One other weakness: an object that was exceeding could not come into contact with any matter or energy during its short journey. If it did so the exceed jump would be cancelled and the object would return to it's previous velocity most likely destroying it in the process.</p>
<p>The genius of the companion class was in its innovative use of a single reactor that produced energy directly compatible with the main engines and main cannon.  Predecessors required a conversion matrix to supply either the main cannon or the propulsion resulting in considerable loss of efficiency.</p>
<p>The design choice to link the main cannon and propulsion was also the companion’s greatest weakness:  For every drop of power that was supplied to the main cannon, the propulsion would be underpowered proportionally and vice versa.</p>
<p>For looks the Calvary sported a sleek design.  It was actually aerodynamic and capable of flight through low density atmospheres. The forward portion housed the bridge and resembled a spear head.  A long neck joined the bridge to the main body of the ship.</p>
<p>The neck housed the cannon barrel which was enclosed inside the hull. Before firing the cannon the hull plating of the neck and parts of the bridge would separate along the lateral seam and the cannon would be lowered beneath the bridge. The Base flared into large delta shaped wings.  The propulsion mechanism consisted of one large main thruster sandwiched by four auxiliary thrusters about one fourth the size of the main thruster.  In retro orientation four additional auxiliary thrusters were positioned in similar fashion with their exhaust ports only slightly protruding beyond the edge of the delta wing.</p>
<p>The Ronin fleet produced no more than six companion class ships in its retinue. They were especially expensive to produce due to the exotic materials and layered construction required to support the exceed engine the razon shields and the main cannon.</p>
<p>Alexander spared no expense in the construction, maintenance and modernization of The Red Destiny.  Support staff joked that every molecule of the ship was slightly better and more expensive than the companion ships of the rank and file.</p>
<p>The small Ronin detachment chunged along as if in morbid resignation.</p>
<p>The power of the Tzo Crystal doubled again.</p>
<p>“Apogee 3.5”, Fae*Dra updated.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="chapter-5-the-surrender"><a class="header" href="#chapter-5-the-surrender">CHAPTER 5: THE SURRENDER</a></h2>
<p>The Red Destiny came to a full stop a mere 100 meters away from Mudd’s flagship.  Her escorts held rear positions at a stand off distance of approximately one kilometer.</p>
<p>“Our pomp and circumstance seems acceptable to them...”  Alexander commented.</p>
<p>“I can kill him now?”, Fae asked like it was nothing.</p>
<p>“NO! wait.  We shouldn’t need to kill anyone. Just talk.” Alexander almost laughed.</p>
<p>They waited.</p>
<p>The size disparity between The Red Destiny and Mudd’s flagship was great–and it betrayed the stark difference in the men’s command styles.  Mudd led his fleet from a giant flagship that when in battle lingered behind several protective phalanxes.  Although Mudd’s ship adopted a protected position when danger was afoot it did not do so due to any lack of prowess.  His ship featured a powerful deflective shield, an assortment of point defense energy weapons, a main hangar that could launch a small squadron of warbots and most importantly a devastatingly powerful main cannon.   Although the ship avoided direct action Mudd would usually directly engage enemy remnants once the outcome was imminently favorable. He would finish his opponents in dramatic flare with his ship's awesome main cannon.</p>
<p>By contrast Alexander’s ship was a large fighter style.  Its role was to penetrate the front line and directly engage the enemy.  Alexander led from the front which inspired great loyalty amongst his troops.</p>
<p>Between The Red Destiny and Mudd’s flagship a giant holographic projection flickered to life.  It was a ten story direct feed of Mudd’s head and shoulders… Mudd was being simultaneously broadcast to the Arks and both fleets–the entire human race was to be witness to this historic transfer of power.</p>
<p>Mudd’s hologram spoke: “Eight years and seven months ago the Zell descended upon the human race. Our species entered its greatest survival challenge by a ruthless and unprovoked enemy.”</p>
<p>“Our sovereignties marshaled their respective fleets to counter the Zell.  The men and women who served were brave and capable–but each fleet faced a larger and unified enemy.  The scattered and uncoordinated response led to unimaginable losses in the early years of conflict–including the complete obliteration of four planetary mega civilizations reducing the total human population by two thirds.”</p>
<p>“The soldiers nobly persevered in pursuit of the impossible task asked of them.  They endured losses that they should not have–not because of any flaw in their character–but because the various command structures lacked a coordinated strategy.”</p>
<p>“Two years into the conflict the Alliance fleet was formed from the governments of the three Arks and the human race began to beat back the Zell.  The key to victory became apparent: ‘Unification.’”</p>
<p>“The Alliance has held off the Zell for the last six years–but we can do better–because the human effort is still not completely unified!”</p>
<p>“Military remnants of the now gone planets survived and remained committed to the cause against the Zell.  These remnants coalesced into what is now known as the Ronin fleet.   They avenged their lost homeworlds ferociously inflicting great damage to our Zell enemies.  The Ronins will forever hold a place of honor in our species history.”</p>
<p>“But today marks an historic change for the Ronins and the Alliance.  Because despite the greatness of both fleets they can be even better!  And we know this from the lesson from our past:  ‘Unification is Victory.’”</p>
<p>“Through Unification, we will do more than hold the Zell at bay.  We will defeat them!  From our victory a long lasting age of peace and rebuilding will commence.”</p>
<p>“I am not the only one that believes in the power of Unification.  For the last six months we have been in negotiations with the leader of the Ronin fleet: Alexander Holmes.  His exploits are famous and no reminding of them is necessary.  Alexander is in agreement that unification is prerequisite to victory.   He is wise enough to know that personal glory must not supersede the greater good.”</p>
<p>“The Alliance is ready to accept you!”  The hatch for the main hangar opened right below the bridge portion of Mudd’s ship.  A welcoming beam of warm light emanated from the hangar and shone upon The Red Destiny.  It looked like a magical tunnel that existed to kindly guide The Red Destiny to its inevitable future.</p>
<p>“Now, I have spoken the words of unification and I have spoken them rightly…  But I am not alone, for Alexander himself shares my vision of a unified effort.  And now I will turn the proceedings over to Alexander so we may hear directly about the future of the Ronins and the Alliance and in fact the future of the entire human race!”</p>
<p>Over the feeds waves of applause and cheering filled the background audio.</p>
<p>From The Red Destiny a holo projector emitted a representation of Alexander.   His projection was just his regular size and comprised his entire body in a standing posture.</p>
<p>The crowd noise settled down and converted to anticipatory listening.</p>
<p>Alexander’s hologram spoke: "Thank You, Mudd for your tribute. I simply can't conclude this ceremony without saying a few words."</p>
<p>“And I always speak from the heart be it to a respected rival or the lowest of scum:”</p>
<p>"Your sacrifice to yourself has earned you a special place in the pantheon of dereliction.  Your incompetence is responsible for our many great defeats.  There are many who have lost their lives because of you and many who will unwittingly lose their lives if you are allowed to continue.</p>
<p>"You have chosen to abandon your duty as a soldier to the very end and usurp power risking the welfare of humanity and all that 'represents the best of our people'.  I refuse to salute you, knowing that even as you fade away, your legacy of cowardice will be an unwelcome black mark on the men and women you betrayed for … well… I don’t know of any good that you have done."</p>
<p>“But I am not all hostility and barbs towards you, my most unworthy rival.  I thought it only kind of me to attend this surrender as promised.  And now we are here.</p>
<p>“I accept YOUR surrender.”</p>
<p>Mudd’s holographic face remained stunned for a moment, then his face seemed to suddenly swell with blood, then he rapidly burst out a series of fragmented responses: <em>“What!?  What is the meaning of this!  You were supposed to…  This is an outrage! How DARE you!”</em></p>
<p>Mudd gathered himself a little and then countered with his first coherent argument: <em>“I am the supreme commander of all military and by democratic decree your fleet is now under my control!  This is treason!  And you have NO standing to make ANY demands of me!”</em>  He had regained coherency but his delivery was rife with agitation making him seem like a man that was about to lose control.</p>
<p>“You have already lost.” Alexander said calmly and then switched off his hologram.  As soon as Alexander delivered this verdict Mudd’s hollow projection jolted in surprise, he turned 180 degrees to see the source of a commotion.  The hologram degraded showing signs of rapid signal decay and then it fizzled out.</p>
<p>“Power has quadrupled since disembarkation. Asymptote in one hour.” Fae-Dra updated Alexander.  “Excellent!  Tracking perfectly!” Alexander said.</p>
<p>The entire human race entered an uneasy wait that lasted several minutes.  Every human alive felt a palpable growing tension as they waited for the situation to progress.  Well, every human besides Alexander who was passing the time by reviewing the current Zell and Human formations.</p>
<p>The Alliance front consisted of hundreds of thousands of phalanxes each composed of many thousands of warbots arranged in an elongated hexagonal shape many layers deep.  Directly in front of the phalanx a similarly shaped directed hexagonal dampening energy shield protected the phalanx, and in some cases spears, lances or cannons protruded from the front line ships beyond the shield to provide some offensive capability.”</p>
<p>Behind the front line tens of thousands of military attack vessels eagerly awaited to fulfill their various roles in battle and behind the attack ships twice as many support vessels lingered.</p>
<p>The power output of The Red Destiny’s reactor doubled again.</p>
<p>The Zell's approach to warfare differed in many ways. Instead of warbots the Zell had the Rabble–which was their lowest ranking warrior caste–quite easy to kill but absolutely overwhelming in numbers.  The Zell threat on the other side of the Rift of Ilus was at least 100 times larger than the entire human fleets combined.</p>
<p>The rabble formed the front line which was one chaotic undulating plane many thousands of kilometers in size.  Sections of the front would shrink or swell to strengthen defense where needed.</p>
<p>The rabble front also generated a protection barrier– in this case it was a green Zell cloud.  The cloud was constantly fed exotic energies which made it look as if it hosted many thunderstorms.   The cloud provided three defenses: first the gas slowed any object attempting to pass through it–not because of friction but with a property shift that decreased the object’s velocity–in many cases objects would come to a complete stop and be stuck in the cloud.  Secondly bolts of energy that resembled lightning randomly streaked in every direction and would cause damage to any object inside the cloud.  Lastly the cloud would dissipate energy blasts making a main cannon attack ineffective.  The cloud varied in thickness in exact proportion to the bulges and divots of the rabble’s front line.</p>
<p>Both Zell and Human phalanxes were practically impossible to break head on, which is why tactics relied on circumventing, outflanking or sapping tactics. Trying to stop an approaching phalanx with anything but another phalanx was tantamount to a human trying to stop a giant rolling boulder with his bare hands.</p>
<p>Alexander’s console indicated that Slither was requesting a communication channel and he accepted the request.  A holo of Slither appeared above his console.  “Secured” he said and his characteristic sinister smile began to grow.  “Well done.” said Alexander as he simultaneously terminated the call in an effort to avoid seeing Slither’s creepy smile grow to completion.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="victory"><a class="header" href="#victory">VICTORY?</a></h1>
<p>The Red Destiny’s power output doubled again and now exceeded the maximum output of an antimatter reactor core.</p>
<p>Alexander stood and resumed his holo broadcast.   The anxiety-wracked population yearned to be soothed.</p>
<p>“I know many are shaken and unsure because of what just happened–that is only natural when the course of life rapidly takes an unexpected turn.  Please give me a chance to explain to you what has happened and to assure you that our future is brighter than it ever has been.”</p>
<p>“First I want to clarify my position: Commander Mudd’s belief that unification is a prerequisite to victory is absolutely correct. I differ with him because of his vain and self-serving approach to merge our forces into one.”</p>
<p>“Consider the conflicting nature of our strategies:  The Ronin fleet’s doctrine is that the Zell should be aggressively attacked whereas Mudd has reduced his fleet's options to purely defensive responses and when faced with a true challenge he favors making a cowardly escape using the civilian fold drives.”</p>
<p>“And consider our track records: The Ronins have scored several decisive victories. We have also experienced loss but never a major defeat.  By contrast Mudd’s leadership was responsible for at least three catastrophic defeats in the early portion of the war–defeats that decimated the Alliance to the extent that we still have not recovered our full strength.  Then he effectively quit the war and followed defensive policies out of fear that he would lose again.”</p>
<p>“One ancient truth that successful war strategist accepted long before the book of Astro Battle was written: ‘He who abandons attack and embraces defense alone has already lost the war.` The harsh reality is that if we maintained a strictly defensive posture we would without question eventually be overrun and annihilated by our enemy.</p>
<p>“Mudd already lost four years ago.  And had I not taken the bold action you just witnessed, the moment that Mudd took control of the Ronin fleet would have marked the moment that the entire human race lost to the Zell.  Our complete extermination as a species would only be a question of time.”</p>
<p>“But some may wonder what action I took exactly so I will share with you:  I ordered Clandestine elements of the Ronin’s to infiltrate the bridge crew of Mudd’s flagship–this took over a year to complete–-our agents waited for this moment to surprise and apprehend him and his top ranking officers. This course of action–quite uncharacteristic of the Ronins who favor direct conflict–this course was chosen because it was the least destructive option–had we escalated to militarily conflict our total fighting force could have been greatly diminished and the only benefactor of the scenario would have been the Zell.”</p>
<p>“Also, I want to announce that I am now in possession of the control codes for the assets of the Alliance fleet AND control codes for the Arks and their fold drives. I have charged myself with the safety and survival of EVERY living human and I accept this noble burden with the utmost sense of responsibility–I hope that brings you comfort.”</p>
<p>“Finally I will tell you how we will ultimately stop running away and bring an end to the Zell menace once and for all.  Our first engagement towards this aim will commence in less than one hour:  The complete destruction of the Zell armada that has been intimidating us for the last week.  We will then launch a campaign that will bring us to the Zell’s strategic weakness–for just as we have three arks that carry our precious civilizations, the Zell also have three major vulnerabilities to their survival.  We have recently learned that the Zell have three planetary hatcher–”, Alexander’s speech was interrupted.”</p>
<p>A holographic disturbance grew in a contorted fashion just in front of Mudd’s flagship.  An unpleasant and loud audio feedback screech drowned out all other sounds for a moment.  The holo projection operator was clearly inexperienced but after his initial stumble he successfully dialed the parameters in a generally correct vector.  It took some seconds for the hologram’s form to become recognizable.  It was Supreme Commander Mudd’s 10 story head and neck again.  His hair and the collar of his uniform appeared to be quite disheveled. A trickle of blood flowing from his hairline suggested he had just been in a scuffle.  He gave a look that hinted that he was resolute, determined and completely furious.</p>
<p>Mudd’s audio became coherent mid sentence: “...CANNOT BE TOLERATED!”</p>
<p>Mudd rambled on excitedly touching on such topics: ‘Alexander was a traitor’, ‘Decent people would not stand for this' and various threats born from his insecurities asserting that Mudd could best Alexander in any combat scenario…</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="a-fight-after-all"><a class="header" href="#a-fight-after-all">A FIGHT AFTER ALL</a></h2>
<p>Alexander looked stunned for some seconds of Mudd's rant.  He deactivated his holo projection.</p>
<p>Alexander’s disappearing hologram agitated Mudd even more.  “Hiding now!? Who’s the real coward!”</p>
<p>Alexander sat in his command chair and urgently fiddled with his console in order to connect with Sliter.  Slither’s hologram appeared–his sinister smile was gone and in its place was a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Alexander asked urgently.</p>
<p>“I cannot ascertain the specifics but it appears that elements of Mudd’s lower ranking team somehow surprised our agents–even though we took every precaution to prevent this scenario–in the ensuing struggle our agents were likely killed but possibly just subdued.  In my judgment we have lost control of Mudd’s flagship and cannot hope to retake it.”</p>
<p>“DAMMIT!”, Alexander exclaimed.  And he banished Slither’s hologram in a frustrated motion.</p>
<p>“Asymptote in 45 minutes–power continues to grow.” Fae-Dra interjected she seemed unphased by the recent reversal of fortunes. She was possibly not paying attention to the happenings at all as none of it involved her which is a common behavior of Androsynth: They ignore everything happening around them that isn’t directly related to their task.</p>
<p>Alexander made an expression of agitation yet made no response.  He was directly behind Fae-Dra and she couldn’t see his reaction and even if she had seen it she was quite inept when it came to understanding body language .  Alexander never scolded Fae-Dra for her faults.  Her tremendous strengths were too valuable to risk losing in a vain attempt to make her behavior more human.</p>
<p>He was staring at the floor, his mind racing with anxiety as he tried to quickly construct a plan B.  The avenues to many strategies were now closed… He had already hoodwinked his adversaries by leading them to believe he would surrender… His speech had been cut off right before he was going to inspire the Alliance men and women to join his banner–although he had the control codes they were not terribly useful without the loyalties of the flesh and blood assets.  His fleet was significantly smaller and not prepared for a battle.  Mudd’s ship was a massive capital ship that in order for the small Red Destiny to defeat would probably require a major blunder from Mudd.</p>
<p>Mudd was still yelling and threatening him.  His weapons were powered up and a visible blue shield barrier was flickering around the entire ship.</p>
<p>It looked bad, yet Alexander had a history of quickly pivoting to new strategies when things didn’t go as planned.  And a plan came to him.</p>
<p>He stood and reactivated his Holoprojector.  He showed complete confidence and zero fear as he interrupted Mudd’s rant.  Mudd listened probably in the hopes that whatever Alexander said would make him MORE mad.</p>
<p>“Commander Mudd!  I’m glad to see that you didn’t just hand over your fleet but instead decided to honor me with a worthy challenge.  I graciously accept!  I have made the claim that you are not worthy to lead the combined fleet and that my leadership would be more suitable.  From a certain point of view this conflict doesn’t involve our fleets at all but is really a conflict between two men.   So let’s treat it as such!  I formally challenge you to a duel!  I’ll even–”</p>
<p>Mudd had heard enough and interrupted: “Accepted!” His hologram disappeared and shortly after Alexander surmised that the discussion was over and deactivated his holoprojection as well.</p>
<p>This was a great development.  Alexander's skill in melee combat was renowned whereas there was no record of Mudd ever engaging in a man-to-man skirmish.  Alexander couldn’t believe Mudd agreed to his long shot.</p>
<p>Alexander relaxed in his chair then suddenly was caught off guard by what he saw on the main viewscreen.  A stream of energy cannon blasts from multiple origin points dotting Mudd’s ship and each stream would converge on The Red Destiny in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>However, No surprise attack imaginable could catch Fae-Dra off guard. She used the exceed engine to nearly instantaneously zip to a position still in front of–but now 15 degrees away from the centerpoint–Mudd’s flagship and a moment later the streams converged on empty space.</p>
<p>The Exceed Engine is what gave the companion class ship its agility and agility was essential to fulfilling the  companion class’s role.  The Exceed Engine performs property shifting on the ship and all its contents.  In an instant the Exceed Engine would reduce the mass of its ship to a micro fraction allowing for a substantial and nearly instant traversal when paired with a coordinated propulsion impulse.  The engine could only be engaged for a fraction of a second then its effect would be nullified causing the ship to resume its pre exceed velocity in an instant.  A major drawback to using exceed is that it also reduced the ship’s atomic cohesion when active which made the ship extremely fragile to the point where collision with a microscopic particle would most likely result in the catastrophic destruction of the ship.  Effectively using Exceed required beyond exceptional piloting skill.</p>
<p>“I was challenging him to a face-to-face duel!” Alexander exclaimed to Fae-Dra who gave the complaint no mind.</p>
<p>A new volley of bolts fired aimed towards The Red Destiny’s new position and like before Fae-Dra elegantly used Exceed to dodge.</p>
<p>Alexander accepted the situation and shifted back to strategizing mode.</p>
<p>His first action was to send a hasty communique to his fleet not to interfere in the battle.  As a matter of fact he made the communique public so that the Alliance fleet would see his command as well.  He knew that a total fleet engagement wouldn’t be good for anyone.</p>
<p>He issued his first order to Fae-Dra: “Sap him.”  Sapping was a strategy companion classes used in order to weaken a powerful reflective shield.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra immediately complied.  She used exceed to close range with the shield to mere centimeters; she then activated The Red Destiny’s Razon shields and boosted directly into the thick shield barrier.  The Red Destiny was deflected but not harmed and the total power of Mudd’s shield had been drained.  Immediately after deflection Fae-Dra used exceed to put a safe distance between the two ships.</p>
<p>The Razon Shields hovered mere millimeters away from the hull plating and wrapped the ship in a bright yellow glow.  Razons were not defensive in nature but instead reinforced the strength of the material they flowed over and annihilated a fraction of a millimeter of any materials that grazed the Razon’s externally facing side .  The Razon Shield’s were employed in two attack variants called Shearing or Sapping depending upon if material or energy was the target.  The maneuver was the linchpin of the companion class’s most common attack: it would literally slice through its adversary’s equipment, shearing through its materials and exiting on the other side.</p>
<p>When attacking an enemy object with a reflective shield the Razons would sap the shield barrier’s power forcing the enemy to replenish the loss with a non-trivial quantity of energy.  The sapping technique when repeated many times would eventually cause the object to exhaust its usable power to the point that it couldn’t maintain its shields and then the companion ship would finish the job with a Shearing attack.</p>
<p>Mudd replenished his shield’s loss as expected.  And he continued to wildly lob cannon blasts at The Red Destiny only for them to be dodged by Fae-Dra’s piloting.</p>
<p>At least Mudd seemed to agree that all out fleet war was inappropriate as he ordered his auxiliary capital ships to surround the battle zone and emit barrier shields which contained his erratic cannon blasts.   Well, it might have been a precaution to prevent collateral damage or it could have been to eliminate any chance of The Red Destiny’s escape.</p>
<p>“After Image”, Alexander instructed Fae.</p>
<p>The After Image technique created 32 very precise holographic representations of The Red Destiny that completely surrounded Mudd’s battleship.  Computer instrumentation could determine if an image was a hologram or not in a fraction of a second–but the second part of the technique rendered the computers completely confused.  Fae-Dra used exceed to rapidly replace a random hologram with the real Red Destiny.  And in a fraction of a second she would exceed again to another random hologram.  Additionally she would make the holograms change their positions in a random and unpredictable pattern.  Mudd could get a reliable lock to fire his cannons as each image was either a hologram or The Red Destiny’s momentary location.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra maintained a fury of After Image leaps yet would at some intervals invoke a Sapping attack.  The technique was working and Alexander could detect the severe taxation on Mudd’s available power–but he was behind schedule and had not determined how long the sapping would take.</p>
<p>Alexander tasked his computer with calculating the estimates and received an unwelcome result: It would take between 4 and 6 hours to completely sap the shields.  He wanted a half hour for the next phase of his plan which required reaching the Asymptote at a precise moment.</p>
<p>From his console he opened a hologram that displayed a searchable schematic of Mudd’s flagship.  He studied it very intently.</p>
<p>“Where is Pete when you need him…”  He lamented. And then had the horrible thought that his old friend might have been killed at this point.  He shook this thought and again directed  his complete concentration to finding a weakness in Mudd’s ship that could be exploited.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra continued her dodges and attacks showing no signs of fatigue.  Mudd tried a variety of techniques to get a lock or in some way to damage The Red Destiny but nothing came close to landing a hit.</p>
<p>Alexander's demeanor became increasingly agitated and showed no signs of approaching a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mudd stopped all its attacks and it began to back away.  Alexander did not once look at the viewscreen but to the side of his work he had a small tactical hologram of the situation.  Alexander directed Fae-Dra to cease the After Image technique as he was not sure what Mudd was up to.  He leaned in even further to the schematics he was studying as if he thought that would make him more perceptive.</p>
<p>As Mudd backed up the capital ship’s providing the enclosing shield approached Mudd’s ship.  Then the final strategy became clear: Mudd began charging up his main cannon.  A ball of energy was coalescing right before Mudd’s ship.</p>
<p>Alexander noticed what was happening a little late.   What he correctly surmised was that Mudd intended to fire a powerful and wide main cannon blast that would fill the entire shielded arena.  Mudd’s capital ships would be fine behind their deflection shields but everything inside the battle arena would have no safe space.</p>
<p>Alexander was quick to pivot when conditions changed.  Although the power core of The Red Destiny was now outputting many times more power than Mudd’s ship, none of his ship systems could handle that much power… well none of them except for the one that Alexander did not want to use.</p>
<p>Companion ship class ships rely on the exceed drive for defense and the Razon shields for offense but it had one more exceptional ability, its trump card if you will.   The Red Destiny had a main cannon of its own… and it was capable of accepting all of Tzo crystal’s energy output and even more.  The drawback of the main cannon was that it typically consumed all of The Red Destiny’s energy which would cause the Tzo crystal reactor to completely shut down leaving Alexander and Fae-Dra completely vulnerable.  The most important consideration when using a companion class’s main cannon was if the blast would be powerful enough to completely wipe out the enemy or if there were other assets in the fight that could defend the depleted ship until the battle was concluded.</p>
<p>In this case the conditions for using the Main Cannon were met.   The Tzo crystal could create a blast that would overwhelm Mudd’s blast and cause the complete obliteration of his ship.  But Alexander didn’t want to use the cannon this way.  First he had been building the energy of the Tzo crystal in order to conduct an immediate surprise attack on the Zell and secondly he dreaded the idea of killing his friend Pete who he convinced to surrender for his benefit only a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>He had to decide fast and since he hadn’t landed on any other options he really had no choice.</p>
<p>“Prepare to fire the main cannon, Fae”, Alexander reluctantly said.</p>
<p>Fae-Dra activated many subsystems through-out the ship.  The Red Destiny had to transform its shape before it could start the cannon build up and ultimate firing.</p>
<p>He turned off his console holograms with a heavy resignation about the decision he was just forced to make.  And for the first time he observed the view screen which displayed a close up of Mudd’s ship.  And… He saw something!</p>
<p>The Red Destiny was still making noises as parts rubbed together and servos whined in the service of transforming the ship to cannon mode.</p>
<p>Alexander entered a hearty laugh and slapped his lap several times.  “Cancel Main Cannon fire!” He said.  And Fae-Dra reversed the process.</p>
<p>“I’m such an idiot… if I had only turned off the tactical readouts earlier!”</p>
<p>Fae-Dra was clueless and uninterested in Alexander’s editorial mumbles.</p>
<p>“It seems our friend Mudd, in his haste to destroy us, forgot to close the hatch to the main hangar that he opened to invite us to our surrender.  Well, I say at this point we accept his invitation and show up in his hangar without delay!”</p>
<p>Alexander then gave Fae-Dra more specific instructions on what he had in mind.  And Fae-Dra and their ship was ready.</p>
<p>Mudd’s main cannon finished its build up phase and dropped his ship’s shields just a moment before unleashing his attack.  The Red Destiny seemed to make no effort to avoid its fate. The arena filled with blinding light.  It lasted for several seconds then began to fade.   And the audience saw… Nothing.   And there was a great pause as the Ronins, the Alliance and every soul aboard the Arks slowly processed the conclusion of a long struggle and what it meant.</p>
<p>Mudd celebrated immediately but was holding for a while to let the magnitude of the event sink in for everyone before he gave his final unifying speech.</p>
<p>The other capital ships solemnly deactivated their containment shields one by one.  The conflict was over and now the arena had to be torn down.</p>
<p>Then an event too shocking to believe completely disrupted the course of history.  The Bridge on top of Mudd’s ship burst open in a mighty explosion and from the wound a magnificent orange contrail grew at a speed that was imperceptible to the human eye.</p>
<p>The Ronin’s knew this contrail well: It was the contrails of a companion class ship.  The contrail zipped around performing several sharp zigzags and then suddenly coming to a complete stop…  The fading contrail led out of the freshly made gape of Mudd’s ship to … The Red Destiny!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unification-at-last"><a class="header" href="#unification-at-last">UNIFICATION AT LAST</a></h1>
<p>The Red Destiny did a victory roll and turned towards the Ronin fleet.  Several ships projected holograms of their crew cheering for the Commander they thought they lost. The Red Destiny then slowed and made a non threatening drift towards the Alliance Fleet.</p>
<p>The flagship was disabled, but not destroyed. It listed in dereliction and contents were still spilling out from the puncture.  Mudd and his command crew had certainly been killed and more would die in the fires raging through the ship.</p>
<p>“A familiar comm request reached Alexander.  Slither survived.  He broadcast on a private channel to the Ronnins: “Deploy marines to perform rescue and suppression of the survivors.  Do not allow the Alliance fleet to participate in the rescue.”  Then only to his snakes: “ If any surviving bridge officers are encountered, kill them as discreetly as possible."</p>
<p>“Pete?” Alexander asked.</p>
<p>“searching.” Slyther responded..</p>
<p>“FIND HIM.” Alexander delivered imperative, he knew the two were not fond of each other.  “Glad you survived”  Slyther’s always-half-smile grew imperceptively then he gave a light bow and backed into the darkness.</p>
<p>"Twenty-Eight minutes until we reach the asymptote," Fae reported.</p>
<p>"Now to secure the loyalty of the Defence fleet. I wish I could do this later, but it has to be now.</p>
<p>"Fae, Are there any corpses floating in space?", Alexander asked.</p>
<p>"Seventeen.", Said Fae.</p>
<p>"Let me see them.  Tractor them with dignity to the Red Destiny. Assume our position for the speech. ", A menu of the seventeen corpses appeared on Alexander's screen each with an accompanying close up video of the body.</p>
<p>"Genlty, place sixteen of the corpses in two rows extending out in front of and slightly below the center line of the Red Destiny. Straighten their bodies.  Take this one", he selected one of the corpses from his corpse menu, "And make his velocity approach the red destiny slowly along the center line of the Red Destiny and in between the two rows of corpses... Do not straighten his body, I like the mangled look it has.  Time everything so the final body meets with me right at the base of the two rows, nearest the Red Destiny. Launch a spy drone and have it film me."</p>
<p>He donned his space helmet and an automatic process began making his armor space worthy.</p>
<p>"How much time do I have?", Alexander asked.</p>
<p>"Five minutes till Asym"</p>
<p>"That will have to do.", Alexander ambled down a hatch on the side of the bridge, exited the forward space hatch, and floated slowly into the dark of space approaching the uneasy Defence fleet.</p>
<p>Now Supreme Commander Alexander drifted solemnly towards the rows of the dead.  The camera drone travelled a meter before him broadcasting to every last human that lived.</p>
<p>His motion came to a rest in between the first row of the dead.   The drone kept floating away and the bodies moved through the broadcast's perspective like church pews move through the perspective of a bride walking down the isle.</p>
<p>The seventeenth entered the scene and Alexander gently stopped its momentum by cradling the body.  Alexander removed his dark-red cape, the symbol of the Ronin Commander, and wrapped it around the mangled body of the poor Alliance man.  And then he steadied the bundle at his feet, in the same plane as the eight other corpses between the two rows but aligned perpendicularly.  Fae subtly used her tractor beam to straighten the final body.</p>
<p>He spoke slowly and stoically. "I speak to all who serve in the Alliance fleet.  And I ask every other human to hear my words, for it is the sacrifice of the Alliance fleet that has protected our race’s future since the Zell first attacked."</p>
<p>"Few soldiers escape death. It never becomes easier to endure.  As noble soldiers your heart can never be numb to this experience. That is what makes you human.  Humanity is amazing that way."</p>
<p>"The life of a single soldier is worth more than the lives of the entire Zell fleet.  But soldiers are made to go in harms way, and soldiers protect what is precious to them no matter the cost.</p>
<p>“The life that has just left us, the life of these soldiers before me, was not given to protect what they cherished.  These lives were squandered in the name of greed and arrogance.  These lives were paid as tribute to serve Commander Mudd’s ambitions."</p>
<p>"I killed these men. I crushed them for why they fough....  But I did so to protect WHAT they fought for."</p>
<p>"More soldiers will die today, but none more will die in vain.  For we must face an enemy four times our strength, before another enemy of an unfathomable size bears down upon us in twenty hours.</p>
<p>Now I ask you to Follow me. Fight for me. Defend what these soldiers protected with their lives… They protected you.  They protected humanity itself.  And that we will do.</p>
<p>And we will do it Not by running away, sculking into the ever deeper levels of hell hoping our enemy tires of pursuit.  We will not only defend the precious human experience but we will bring an end to the Zell for good!"</p>
<p>"You have heard my rationale and now you must choose. Defenceless, I stand before you and I ask you to join my fleet or avenge your unworthy Commander and kill me now. "</p>
<p>A long pause followed.</p>
<p>Crew Holo projections began appearing in front of the Alliance fleet.  Emotional clapping and approval poured out from the Holoprojections.</p>
<p>"We have messages from the entire defence fleet.  They have consented to join you.” from Slyther.</p>
<p>“Twenty-Three then asym.", Fae Reported.   Little time remained for Alexander’s plan.</p>
<p>"I am deeply humbled that you have accepted me as your Commander. I will treat your trust with the honor that it has always deserved!"</p>
<p>"Now Let us crush the Zell and rid the universe of their evil forever! TO WAR!"</p>
<p>Loud cheering erupted from holo projections of both fleets.</p>
<p>Fae*Dra  tractored Alexander and the bodies into the entry portal.  The bodies lay strewn about the exit ready room in complete disarray. Alexander had to shove and kick them into place as he had no other free space to store them.  Alex retrieved his red cape from the mangled corpse, put it on and resumed his position in the Bridge.</p>
<p>Alexander transmitted another prepared message instructing the former Alliance fleet where to maneuver and how they were going to participate in this battle.  For the most part he left the Alliance fleet in the same protective position, but he moved some Seventy-Five thousand phalanx unit and Twenty-Five thousand skirmishers to the front line.</p>
<p>"stink!", Fae was righ…. Unsightly dead bodies stink. “Eject them!” She posited.</p>
<p>"That might send the wrong signal to the fleet.  Sorry we have to tolerate the smell.  We can incinerate them further in space we are out of view.", Alexander explained.</p>
<p>Fae lit the boosters and the Red Destiny raced to the front planes.  A ronin entourage followed as well as some newly acquired hodge podge of Alliance ships.</p>
<p>“Now for the battle of Illus and victory”, Alex said confidently.</p>
