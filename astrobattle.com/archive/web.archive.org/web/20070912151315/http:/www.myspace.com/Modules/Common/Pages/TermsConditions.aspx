<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: #ff6600">MySpace.com Terms of Use Agreement<br><br>April 11, 2007</p>
<p>MySpace.com is a social networking service that allows Members to create unique personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new friends. The services offered by MySpace.com ("Myspace.com" or "we") include the MySpace.com website (the "MySpace Website"), the MySpace.com Internet messaging service, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by MySpace.com in connection with the MySpace Website (collectively, the "MySpace Services"). The MySpace Services are hosted in the U.S.</p>
<p>This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the MySpace Services. By using the MySpace Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the MySpace Website) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with Myspace.com). The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the MySpace Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and to this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and save it. If you do not agree with it, you should leave the MySpace Website and discontinue use of the MySpace Services immediately. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members and make use of the MySpace Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the Registration process.</p>
<p>This Agreement includes MySpace.com's policy for acceptable use of the MySpace Services and Content posted on the MySpace Website, your rights, obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the MySpace Services and MySpace.com's Privacy Policy. In order to participate in certain MySpace Services, you may be notified that you are required to download software or content and/or agree to additional terms and conditions. Unless otherwise provided by the additional terms and conditions applicable to the MySpace Services in which you choose to participate, those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement. You may receive a copy of this Agreement by emailing us at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070912083323/mailto:privacy@MySpace.com">privacy@MySpace.com</a>, Subject: Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>MySpace.com may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modification shall be effective upon posting by MySpace.com on the MySpace Website. You agree to be bound to any changes to this Agreement when you use the MySpace Services after any such modification is posted. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.</p>
<p>Please choose carefully the information you post on MySpace.com and that you provide to other Users. Your MySpace.com profile may not include the following items: telephone numbers, street addresses, last names, and any photographs containing nudity, or obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable subject matter. Despite this prohibition, information provided by other MySpace.com Members (for instance, in their Profile) may contain inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive or sexually explicit material, products or services, and MySpace.com assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the MySpace Services by any person, please contact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070912083323/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.goto&amp;_i=895395ac-8a2c-4b9f-9417-35c16549855c&amp;_u=http%3a%2f%2fviewmorepics.myspace.com%2findex.cfm%3ffuseaction%3dmisc.contact" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='https://web.archive.org/web/20070912083323/http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.contact';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';">MySpace</a> or click on the "Report Inappropriate Content" link at the bottom of any MySpace.com page.</p>
<p>MySpace.com reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any posting (including private messages) by you, or to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the MySpace Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability.Â  MySpace expressly reserves the right to remove your profile and/or restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to any part of MySpace Services if MySpace determines, in its sole discretion, that you pose a threat to MySpace and/or its Users.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eligibility.</strong> Use of and Membership in the MySpace Services is void where prohibited. By using the MySpace Services, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 14 years of age or older; and (d) your use of the MySpace Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Your profile may be deleted and your Membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you are under 14 years of age. 
<li><strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the MySpace Services or are a Member. You may terminate your Membership at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Member's Account Settings page. MySpace.com may terminate your Membership at any time, without warning. Even after Membership is terminated, this Agreement will remain in effect, including sections 5-17. 
<li><strong>Fees.</strong> You acknowledge that MySpace.com reserves the right to charge for the MySpace Services and to change its fees from time to time in its discretion. If MySpace.com terminates your Membership because you have breached the Agreement, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of subscription fees. 
<li><strong>Password.</strong> When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You agree not to use the account, username, or password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to notify MySpace.com immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your password. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your account. 
<li><strong>Non-commercial Use by Members.</strong> The MySpace Services are for the personal use of Members only and may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavors except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by MySpace.com. Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the MySpace Services, including collecting usernames and/or email addresses of Members by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited email or unauthorized framing of or linking to the MySpace Website is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, and other forms of solicitation may be removed from Member profiles without notice and may result in termination of Membership privileges. Appropriate legal action will be taken for any illegal or unauthorized use of the MySpace Services. 
<li><strong>Proprietary Rights in Content on MySpace.com.</strong> 
<ol>
<li>MySpace.com does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post to the MySpace Services. After posting your Content to the MySpace Services, you continue to retain all ownership rights in such Content, and you continue to have the right to use your Content in any way you choose. By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the MySpace Services, you hereby grant to MySpace.com a limited license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content solely on and through the MySpace Services. 
<p>Without this license, MySpace.com would be unable to provide the MySpace Services. For example, without the right to modify Member Content, MySpace.com would not be able to digitally compress music files that Members submit or otherwise format Content to satisfy technical requirements, and without the right to publicly perform Member Content, MySpace.com could not allow Users to listen to music posted by Members. The license you grant to MySpace.com is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to MySpace.com), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that MySpace.com is not required to pay you for the use on the MySpace Services of the Content that you post), sublicensable (so that MySpace.com is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors such as Internet content delivery networks to provide the MySpace Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the MySpace Services are global in reach). This license will terminate at the time you remove your Content from the MySpace Services. The license does not grant MySpace.com the right to sell your Content, nor does the license grant MySpace.com the right to distribute your Content outside of the MySpace Services.</p>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the MySpace Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the MySpace Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of any Content posted by you to or through the MySpace Services. 
<li>The MySpace Services contain Content of MySpace.com ("MySpace.com Content"). MySpace.com Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and MySpace.com owns and retains all rights in the MySpace.com Content and the MySpace Services. MySpace.com hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the MySpace.com Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the MySpace Website and using the MySpace Services. 
<li>The MySpace Services contain Content of Users and other MySpace.com licensors. Except for Content posted by you, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the MySpace Services.</li></ol>
<li><strong>Content Posted.</strong> 
<ol>
<li>MySpace.com may delete any Content that in the sole judgment of MySpace.com violates this Agreement or which may be offensive, illegal or violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of any person. MySpace.com assumes no responsibility for monitoring the MySpace Services for inappropriate Content or conduct. If at any time MySpace.com chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the MySpace Services, MySpace.com nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting any such Content. 
<li>You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through any of the MySpace Services, and any material or information that you transmit to other Members and for your interactions with other Users. MySpace.com does not endorse and has no control over the Content. Content is not necessarily reviewed by MySpace.com prior to posting and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of MySpace.com. MySpace.com makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the Content or to the accuracy and reliability of the Content or any material or information that you transmit to other Members.</li></ol>
<li><strong>Content/Activity Prohibited.</strong> The following is a partial list of the kind of Content that is illegal or prohibited to post on or through the MySpace Services. MySpace.com reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in MySpace.com's sole discretion, violates this provision, including without limitation, removing the offending communication from the MySpace Services and terminating the Membership of such violators. Prohibited Content includes, but is not limited to Content that, in the sole discretion of MySpace.com: 
<ol>
<li>is patently offensive and promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual; 
<li>harasses or advocates harassment of another person; 
<li>exploits people in a sexual or violent manner; 
<li>contains nudity, violence, or offensive subject matter or contains a link to an adult website;

<li>promotes information that you know is false or misleading or promotes illegal activities or conduct that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory or libelous; 
<li>promotes an illegal or unauthorized copy of another person's copyrighted work, such as providing pirated computer programs or links to them, providing information to circumvent manufacture-installed copy-protect devices, or providing pirated music or links to pirated music files; 
<li>involves the transmission of "junk mail," "chain letters," or unsolicited mass mailing, instant messaging, "spimming," or "spamming"; 
<li>contains restricted or password only access pages or hidden pages or images (those not linked to or from another accessible page); 
<li>furthers or promotes any criminal activity or enterprise or provides instructional information about illegal activities including, but not limited to making or buying illegal weapons, violating someone's privacy, or providing or creating computer viruses;

<li>includes a photograph of another person that you have posted without that person's consent; or 
<li>for band and filmmaker profiles, uses sexually suggestive imagery or any other unfair, misleading or deceptive Content intended to draw traffic to the profile.</li></ol>
<p>The following is a partial list of the kind of activity that is illegal or prohibited on the MySpace Website and through your use of the MySpace Services. MySpace.com reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in MySpace.com's sole discretion, violates this provision, including without limitation, reporting you to law enforcement authorities. Prohibited activity includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>criminal or tortious activity, including child pornography, fraud, trafficking in obscene material, drug dealing, gambling, harassment, stalking, spamming, spimming, sending of viruses or other harmful files, copyright infringement, patent infringement, or theft of trade secrets; 
<li>advertising to, or solicitation of, any Member to buy or sell any products or services through the MySpace Services. You may not transmit any chain letters or junk email to other Members. It is also a violation of these rules to use any information obtained from the MySpace Services in order to contact, advertise to, solicit, or sell to any Member without their prior explicit consent. In order to protect our Members from such advertising or solicitation, MySpace.com reserves the right to restrict the number of emails which a Member may send to other Members in any 24-hour period to a number which MySpace.com deems appropriate in its sole discretion. If you breach this Agreement and send unsolicited bulk email, instant messages or other unsolicited communications of any kind through the MySpace Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to MySpace.com, but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain. As a reasonable estimation of such harm, you agree to pay MySpace.com $50 for each such unsolicited email or other unsolicited communication you send through the MySpace Services; 
<li>covering or obscuring the banner advertisements on your personal profile page, or any MySpace.com page via HTML/CSS or any other means; 
<li>any automated use of the system, such as using scripts to add friends or send comments or messages; 
<li>interfering with, disrupting, or creating an undue burden on the MySpace Services or the networks or services connected to the MySpace Services; 
<li>attempting to impersonate another Member or person; 
<li>for band profiles, copying the code for your MySpace Player and embedding it into other profiles or asking other Members to embed it into their profiles; 
<li>using the account, username, or password of another Member at any time or disclosing your password to any third party or permitting any third party to access your account; 
<li>selling or otherwise transferring your profile; 
<li>using any information obtained from the MySpace Services in order to harass, abuse, or harm another person; 
<li>displaying an advertisement on your profile, or accepting payment or anything of value from a third person in exchange for your performing any commercial activity on or through the MySpace Services on behalf of that person, such as placing commercial content on your profile, posting blogs or bulletins with a commercial purpose, selecting a profile with a commercial purpose as one of your "Top 8" friends, or sending private messages with a commercial purpose; or 
<li>using the MySpace Services in a manner inconsistent with any and all applicable laws and regulations.</li></ol>
<li><strong>Copyright Policy.</strong> You may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others without obtaining the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is the policy of MySpace.com to terminate Membership privileges of any Member who repeatedly infringes the copyright rights of others upon receipt of proper notification to MySpace.com by the copyright owner or the copyright owner's legal agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the MySpace Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our Copyright Agent with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the MySpace Services; (iv) your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf. MySpace.com's Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows: Copyright Agent, MySpace, Inc., 8391 Beverly Blvd., #349, Los Angeles, CA 90048; Facsimile: (310) 969-7394; Attn: Copyright Agent; and email: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070912083323/mailto:copyrightagent@myspace.com">copyrightagent@myspace.com</a>.

Profiles created and posted by Members on the MySpace Website may contain links to other websites. MySpace.com is not responsible for the Content, accuracy or opinions expressed on such websites, and such websites are in no way investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by MySpace.com. Inclusion of any linked website on the MySpace Services does not imply approval or endorsement of the linked website by MySpace.com. When you access these third-party sites, you do so at your own risk. MySpace.com takes no responsibility for third party advertisements which are posted on this MySpace Website or through the MySpace Services, nor does it take any responsibility for the goods or services provided by its advertisers. MySpace.com is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any User of the MySpace Services.

Under no circumstances shall MySpace.com be responsible for any loss or damage, including personal injury or death, resulting from use of the MySpace Services, attendance at a MySpace.com event, from any Content posted on or through the MySpace Services, or from the conduct of any Users of the MySpace Services, whether online or offline. The MySpace Services are provided "AS-IS" and as available and MySpace.com expressly disclaims any warranty of fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. MySpace.com cannot guarantee and does not promise any specific results from use of the MySpace Services. 
<li><strong>Limitation on Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT SHALL MYSPACE.COM BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF MYSPACE.COM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, MYSPACE.COM'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO MYSPACE.COM FOR THE MYSPACE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF MEMBERSHIP. 
<li><strong>U.S. Export Controls.</strong> Software available in connection with the MySpace Services (the "Software") is further subject to United States export controls. No Software may be downloaded from the MySpace Services or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Downloading or using the Software is at your sole risk.

Either MySpace.com or you may demand that any dispute between MySpace.com and you about or involving the MySpace Services must be settled by arbitration utilizing the dispute resolution procedures of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Los Angeles, California, USA, provided that the foregoing shall not prevent MySpace.com from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
<li><strong>Indemnity.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold MySpace.com, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the MySpace Services in violation of this Agreement and/or arising from a breach of this Agreement and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above and/or if any Content that you post on the MySpace Website or through the MySpace Services causes MySpace.com to be liable to another. 
<li><strong>Other.</strong> This Agreement is accepted upon your use of the MySpace Website or any of the MySpace Services and is further affirmed by you becoming a Member. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and MySpace.com regarding the use of the MySpace Services. The failure of MySpace.com to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. MySpace.com is a trademark of MySpace, Inc.
