	<h2 class="imgrep about">About phpBB</h2>
	<p>Since its inception, phpBB has been among the leading bulletin board solutions and quickly rose to be the world's leading Open Source forum software. phpBB has always comprised of a key feature set, including powerful permission systems, private messaging, search functions, a customisable template and language system, as well as support for multiple databases.</p>
	<p>The latest major release, phpBB3 &ldquo;Olympus&rdquo;, brings with it many phpBB firsts, such as custom bbCodes and profile requirements, support for subforums and attachments as well as an abundance of other commonly requested features.</p>
	<p>phpBB was first created in June 2000 by James Atkinson, known in the phpBB community as theFinn. In December 2000, v1.0.0 was released, with subsequent releases in the 1.x line continuing until November 2001 when v1.4.4 was made public. This would be the final release in the 1.x series. Meanwhile, progress was being made on v2.0.0, which was later released in April 2002.</p>
	<p>In the 5 years that have followed, phpBB2 has gained a huge following worldwide and has played an important role in defining the success of Open Source software.</p>
	<p>phpBB3 &ldquo;Olympus&rdquo;, which has been in the making since 2002, made its Release Candidate debut in May 2007.</p>
	<p>The group of individuals behind phpBB all share a passion for Open Source software. The phpBB Group has maintained its ambitions since its formation in 2000; to continue developing and supporting a stable, <strong>free</strong>, Open Source bulletin board system.</p>
