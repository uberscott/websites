Of course there may be more release candidates.<br /><br />On release candidates full support is given, allowing language packs as well as modifications and styles. We only give support to those having a clean RC installation or updates from RC1, previous conversions or updates from betas <span style="font-weight: bold">will not be supported here</span>. We encourage only those running the release candidates wanting to test out the new version, it is still recommended to wait for the full release; after all this is a release <span style="font-weight: bold">candidate</span>.<br /><br />During the last weeks the convertor have seen a lot of bugfixes and updates, guaranteeing a much more stable conversion as well as numerous updates.

Constructive criticism is welcome.<br /><br />In order to have structure during this convention, we will have specific slots during the day in which each topic will be discussed. It is not mandatory that you ask questions during the exact specified time slots, though it will help facilitate discussion.

								After 5 years and 7 months Jonathan &quot;SHS`&quot; Roger Stanley is leaving the phpBB project and stepping down from his current Project Manager position, leaving me alone as the longest serving member on the team. After <a href="http&#58;//lambcutlet&#46;org/gallery/World_2005" class="postlink">traveling around the world in 2005</a> and dedicating full time to phpBB afterwards, he finally decided that it is time to take care for himself again and bid us farewell.<br /><br />He informed the team leaders 6 months ago of his intention to leave after RC1 was released and though we all tried to convince him to stay, we understand and respect his decision. We thank Jon for all the hard work he has done for the project. Without him we wouldn't be as far as we are today. <br /><br />Just to give some examples of his dedication: <br />During the 2 weeks we switched over to the new website he worked 14 hours / day, managing the server, converting database after database,to finally give the community phpbb.com back. But even during the calmer periods he spent up to 50 hours / week on the project managing advertisements, server maintenance, helped the developers and translators on the language files, and set up some plans that you will learn about soon. We don't even need to mention his many years as Moderator and Team Leader.<br /><br />We wish Jon all the best and hope he finds his way back to phpBB at some time in the future! Make sure to visit his <a href="http&#58;//lambcutlet&#46;org/" class="postlink">personal website</a> (lambcutlet.org) every now and then.<br /><br /><br />PS: Look out for an announcement with the title &quot;A return&quot; during the next few days <img src="http://www.phpbb.com/community/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />							</xhtml:div>

						<atom:title>Small Status Update - phpBB3</atom:title>
											<atom:content type="xhtml" xml:base="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=538609">

								Hello,<br /><br />i think it is time to give you a small heads up about the current status of phpBB3 (Olympus) now the Beta5 release was quite some time ago. :/<br /><br />The next intended release is indeed RC1. Those bugs currently tagged as &quot;review later&quot; within the bug tracker are those we will get to after RC1 is released - to us they are non-critical, minor bugs which can be handled with at a later stage. At the moment the code base is nearly RC1-ready, but there is still one component we want to finalize (apart from the remaining critical bugs) being the captcha which has shown to be not as effective as we thought (we used third party code and hoped it being more matured than ours). Once the remaining critical bugs are fixed and the captcha problem being resolved we will release the first release candidate.<br /><br />Please note, that with the first release candidate we won't provide a full update package for beta5 to RC1 - we were not able to due to the added files (changes within the installer) and the addition of prosilver as well as the renaming from subSilver to subsilver2. This only affects the files, which need to be updated by hand if you want to go through updating. Regarding the database update from Beta5 to RC1, those on MySQL &lt;= 4.0.3 would need to completely re-install, all others will be able to update their databases of course (the database update script will be provided).<br /><br />To re-iterate our support schema once RC1 is out:<br /><br />We <span style="font-weight: bold">won't support</span> the following installation types:<br /><ul><li>Updates from phpBB3 Beta versions to phpBB3 RC1 and higher</li><li>Conversions from phpBB 2.0.x to phpBB3 Beta versions</li><li>phpBB3 Beta installations</li></ul><br />We give support for the following installation types:<br /><ul><li>Updates from phpBB3 RC1 to any higher version (not relevant at the moment)</li><li>Conversions from phpBB 2.0.x to phpBB3 RC1 and higher</li><li>New installations of phpBB3 RC1 and higher</li></ul><br />So, what can <span style="font-weight: bold">you</span> do to speed up the process of releasing RC1?<br /><br />Beside bug reporting (and trying to provide solutions) - have a look at the <a href="http&#58;//www&#46;phpbb&#46;com/support/documentation/" class="postlink">documentation</a>. <img src="http://www.phpbb.com/community/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> We still consider opening up the documentation for others to contribute, even if it may only be for adding comments. <img src="http://www.phpbb.com/community/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Our documentation team would be happy to receive feedback and maybe also partly written paragraphs? <img src="http://www.phpbb.com/community/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />The phpBB Team.							</xhtml:div>

								Hello all. Took a little longer than planned (the live DB is a bit slower as it's shared <img src="http://www.phpbb.com/community/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) however approved MODs and Styles should be downloadable again without having to jump through hoops.<br /><br />Submitting new MODs and Styles, along with validation of submitted MODs and Styles are still work-in-progress and we hope to have them back in a week or so.<br /><br />Cheers! <img src="http://www.phpbb.com/community/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />							</xhtml:div>
