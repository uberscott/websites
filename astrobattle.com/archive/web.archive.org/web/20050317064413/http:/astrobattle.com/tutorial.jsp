<p class="subHeader">SHIPYARD TUTORIAL</p>
The shipyard is the place where spaceships are constructed.  All ships in Astro Battle are made of modules.  
<p>
To make a workable ship in Astro Battle a module must have the following modules at the minimum:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>One and only one bridge (for controlling the ship and supplying repair)</li>
	<li>At least one power generator which will regenerate power that can be used by all the modules (most modules consume more power than one generator can produce in a single cycle)</li>
	<li>At least one battery to store excess power from the generator and supply power to the other modules when needed</li>
	<li>At least one form of linear propulsion module so the ship can move</li>
	<li>At least four maneuvering thrusters to turn the ship in the proper direction</li>
  <li>At least one weapon module</li>
</ol>
<p>
<p>
<p class="subHeader">USING THE DESIGN TOOL</p>
There are three steps to build a workable space ship:
<ol>
<li>Adding modules to the <b>DESIGN PANEL</b></li>
<li>Joining the modules together in the desired arrangement</li>
<li>Wiring the modules so the computer will know which module to activate when a specific button is pressed during pilot mode</li>
</ol>

<p>
<p>
<p class="subHeader">GETTING TO THE SHIPYARD AND CREATING A NEW DESIGN</p>
To get to the shipyard, start the game and select <b>LUNA SHIPYARD</b> from the main menu.  
<p>
<b>LUNA SHIPYARD</b> should look like this (this picture illustrates the location of the DESIGN PANEL):
<p>
<center><img src="/web/20050418005908im_/http://astrobattle.com/img/tutorial/designpanel.gif"></center>
<p>


If there is already a ship and you want to clear it, click the NEW button from the <b>SHIPYARD MENU</b> on the upper left.
<p>
<b><p class="subHeader">ADDING MODULES</p></b>
To add a module to the design:
<center><img src="/web/20050418005908im_/http://astrobattle.com/img/tutorial/draganddrop.gif"></center>

<ol>
<li>Drag and drop a module from the <b>MODULE SELECTION PANEL</b> to the <b>DESIGN PANEL</b>. (You may have to hold down the mouse button for a moment before the dragging takes affect.)</li> 
</ol>

<p>
<p class="subHeader">JOINING MODULES</p>

to join two modules together:<p>
<img src="/web/20050418005908im_/http://astrobattle.com/img/tutorial/command.gif">
<p>
<img src="/web/20050418005908im_/http://astrobattle.com/img/tutorial/join.gif">
<ol>
<li>Select the <b>JOIN</b> button from the <b>COMMAND PANEL</b></li>
<li>Click on the first module you want to join (the connectors of the selected modules will appear )</li>
<li>Choose one of the connectors by clicking on it (that connector should turn gold and all of the possible connection points on the other modules will appear)</li>
<li>Choose the connector on the second module where you want the first module to be attached. (the first module will jump to that position, performing any moving and rotating needed to fit)</li>
</ol>

<p>
<p class="subHeader">WIRING MODULES</p>

For the modules to understand when they should be activated, they must be <em>wired</em> or <em>grouped</em> to specific buttons on your keyboard.
<p>
To wire the modules:
<p>
<center><img src="/web/20050418005908im_/http://astrobattle.com/img/tutorial/wire.gif"></center>

<ol>
<li>click on the <b>WIRE</b> button from the <b>COMMAND PANEL</b> (the <b>MODULE SELECTION PANEL</b> should be replaced by the <b>GROUP SELECTION PANEL</b>)</li>
<li>Select the group you wish to wire (in this example <b>PRIMARY WEAPON GROUP</b> which is controlled by the &quot;<b>F</b>&quot; key)</li>
<li>Select the module or modules you want to activate when that button is pressed (the module should have a gold box painted around it indicating that it has been added to that group)</li>
</ol>
<p>
<p>
<p class="subHeader">PRACTICE ARENA</p>
After you have created your space ship and saved it you can test it by selecting <b>PRACTICE ARENA</b> from the main menu.  Your vehicle will be available for play in the <b>VEHICLE SELECTION</b> frame which will popup before you can enter the game.
<p>
<p>
<p class="subHeader">LUNA STATION</p>
When you have gotten all the kinks out of your ships design, it is time to go to LUNA STATION and test your design against other players.
