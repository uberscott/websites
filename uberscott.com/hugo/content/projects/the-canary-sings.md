## Project 
A Mobile App Dashboard for your Shopify Store

## What is it?
Shopify owners need to know if their store is profitable on the go... this is especially true if they are paying for variable Facebook Ads!  The Canary Sings tracks the profitability of your store by subtracting Cost of Goods and Facebook Ads from Sales in real time and sings a little song every time your store makes a sale!

## What I did
Programmed the Java Backend and Flutter Frontend.  I even animated the little Canary!

## What Happened?
Nobody downloaded this App.  I mean not a single person.  Its defunct now but it was quite the App!
