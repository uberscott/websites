## Project 
A Kubernetes Operator for Automatically Refreshing Your Let's Encrypt Certificates

## What is it?
DevOps people are too important to be bothered with remembering to keep SSL certs up to date!  That's why we just let our bosses nag us about it when the site goes down!  But now there's a better way, you can get Recert 5 to automatically renew your SSL Certs for you!

## Circa 
2020 - CURRENT 

## What I did
Golang using RedHat Operator SDK
