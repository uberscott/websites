## Project 
This project turned out to be a complete waste of time because I was unaware that CERT MANAGER existed!  Anyway this is A Kubernetes Operator for Automatically Refreshing Your Let's Encrypt Certificates... please do not use it as this sort of thing is now maintained by a self avowed stand up comedian with no interest any more in certificates

## What is it?
DevOps people are too important to be bothered with remembering to keep SSL certs up to date!  That's why we just let our bosses nag us about it when the site goes down!  But now there's a better way, you can get Recert 5 to automatically renew your SSL Certs for you!

## What I did
Golang using RedHat Operator SDK

## VIDEO
check out the video... it's mildly funny.
