## Project 
Warner Brothers Maximum Movie Mode for Blu-Ray.

## What is it?
When the Maximum Movie Mode feature was playing the movie experience was enhanced with voice overs, picture in picture windows, gallery link outs and fact popups about the making of the movie not to mention the director would sometimes pause the movie, step in front of the screen and talk directly to the audience.

## Circa 
2009 - 2013


## What I did
Programmed the Maximum Movie Mode engine used in THE WATCHMEN, SHERLOCK HOLMES 1 & 2, TERMINATOR 4 and more.

## Interesting Note
Robert Downey Junior hosted Sherlock Homles 2.  When the production company filmed him I asked if they thought Mr. Downey would like to meet a real life Java programmer on account of he had probably never met one before.  They said "no."
