## Project 
A 2D space shooter where players can build a space ship and then fight with it online

## Customer 
Enthusiastic fans of 2D space shooters all over the world! By the end of it's run Astro Battle had 25,000 members and a core base of players that played the game every night.

## Features
Players can build a ship by snapping several "modules" together.  The positioning and weight of the ship modules affects the game physics when playing online.  Real-time multiplayer online action.

## What I did
I programmed this game from scratch and hired people to create graphic art and assets.  The game was actually popular circa 2004-2006, but since then I haven't had time to work on it.
