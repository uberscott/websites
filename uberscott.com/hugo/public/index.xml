      <description>BRIBING PEOPLE WITH GUM FOR A JOB I seem to always be in need of a job. To make my application stand out I decided to run an experiment where I offered a stick of gum just for reading my resume. The experiment failed miserably.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a youtube video of me reading the letter: And here&amp;rsquo;s the cover letter in full.&#xA;SUBECT A STICK OF GUM FOR YOU, NO QUESTIONS ASKED</description>

      <description>Project Astro Battle &amp;ndash; An Online Multiplayer Space Shooter&#xA;What is it? A 2D space shooter where players could build a space ship and then play with it online! Players built ships by snapping several &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; together&amp;hellip; The positioning and weight of the ship modules affected the ships physics when playing online. AND the fun part was that players could fight with other players in an arena to see whos piloting and ship building skill was better!</description>

      <description>Project Warner Brothers Maximum Movie Mode for Blu-Ray.&#xA;What is it? When the Maximum Movie Mode feature was playing the movie experience was enhanced with voice overs, picture in picture windows, gallery link outs and fact popups about the making of the movie not to mention the director would sometimes pause the movie, step in front of the screen and talk directly to the audience.&#xA;Circa 2009 - 2013&#xA;What I did Programmed the Maximum Movie Mode engine used in THE WATCHMEN, SHERLOCK HOLMES 1 &amp;amp; 2, TERMINATOR 4 and more.</description>

      <description>Project This project turned out to be a complete waste of time because I was unaware that CERT MANAGER existed! Anyway this is A Kubernetes Operator for Automatically Refreshing Your Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Certificates&amp;hellip; please do not use it as this sort of thing is now maintained by a self avowed stand up comedian with no interest any more in certificates&#xA;What is it? DevOps people are too important to be bothered with remembering to keep SSL certs up to date!</description>

      <description>Project An Orchestration and Infrastructure Framework for WebAssembly Components&#xA;What is WebAssembly? WebAssembly (Wasm) is going to disrupt the industry in the next few years. Its a standard for a deterministic virtual machine which is completely isolated from the host environment (it cannot make any dangerous system calls.) Guest method invocation on a host must be explicitly whitelisted. WebAssembly was introduced as a high performance alternative to JavaScript on the browser but in the coming years its compact and secure nature has made it an obvious choice for the backend and in particular will probably replace or augment containers.</description>
