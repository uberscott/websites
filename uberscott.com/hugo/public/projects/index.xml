Players built ships by snapping several &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; together&amp;hellip; The positioning and weight of the ship modules affected the ships physics when playing online. AND the fun part was that players could fight with other players in an arena to see whos piloting and ship building skill was better!</description>

      <description>Project Warner Brothers Maximum Movie Mode for Blu-Ray.
What is it? When the Maximum Movie Mode feature was playing the movie experience was enhanced with voice overs, picture in picture windows, gallery link outs and fact popups about the making of the movie not to mention the director would sometimes pause the movie, step in front of the screen and talk directly to the audience.
Circa 2009 - 2013
What I did Programmed the Maximum Movie Mode engine used in THE WATCHMEN, SHERLOCK HOLMES 1 &amp;amp; 2, TERMINATOR 4 and more.</description>
