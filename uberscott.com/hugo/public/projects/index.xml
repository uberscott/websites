Players built ships by snapping several &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; together&amp;hellip; The positioning and weight of the ship modules affected the ships physics when playing online.

      <description>Project Warner Brothers Maximum Movie Mode for Blu-Ray.&#xA;What is it? When the Maximum Movie Mode feature was playing the movie experience was enhanced with voice overs, picture in picture windows, gallery link outs and fact popups about the making of the movie not to mention the director would sometimes pause the movie, step in front of the screen and talk directly to the audience.&#xA;Circa 2009 - 2013&#xA;What I did Programmed the Maximum Movie Mode engine used in THE WATCHMEN, SHERLOCK HOLMES 1 &amp;amp; 2, TERMINATOR 4 and more.</description>

      <description>Project This project turned out to be a complete waste of time because I was unaware that CERT MANAGER existed! Anyway this is A Kubernetes Operator for Automatically Refreshing Your Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Certificates&amp;hellip; please do not use it as this sort of thing is now maintained by a self avowed stand up comedian with no interest any more in certificates&#xA;What is it?
