# WHA?
These are my personal websites... two at the time of this writing "uberscott.com" and "starlane.io".   Both are static sites generated by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## HOW TO RUN
```bash
cd starlane.io/hugo
hugo server -D
```
The above should print something like this:
```bash
Watching for changes in /Users/scott/websites/starlane.io/hugo/{archetypes,content,layouts,static,themes}
Watching for config changes in /Users/scott/websites/starlane.io/hugo/config.toml

Now you can go to [http://localhost:1313] to see the site executing locally

## CONTENT
check out "`<site name>`/hugo/content" you should see .md files (mark down) ... hugo is transforming these markdown content files with a theme in hugo/themes/<sitename>/...
