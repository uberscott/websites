          <p>
            Starlane is a Mesh that is extensible via WebAssembly code for the
            cloud, the edge, desktop, mobile and IoT environments.
          </p>
          <h2 id="a-server-to-client-mesh">A SERVER TO CLIENT MESH</h2>
          <p>
            Starlane is a special type of Mesh that spans from the server to
            client. This special Mesh facilitates the execution of WebAssembly
            at every level. To accomplish this feat Starlane provides the
            following :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Starlane host environments which can run on the client or the
              server and connect to other Starlane hosts
            </li>
            <li>
              An Artifact Bundle repository which allows resources to reference,
              download and cache configurations, executable Wasm code and
              assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              A simple to use message passing framework enabling WebAssembly
              actors to interact with any other resources connected to the Mesh.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Mesh Portal API for connecting non-WebAssembly backend micro
              services to the mesh.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extendable resources such as Databases, FileSystems, Message
              Queues etc– all of which can process Starlane messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Simple to implement Framework which makes it easy for
              WebAssembly to interoperate with the host Starlane Mesh.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="why-webassembly">WHY WEBASSEMBLY?</h3>
          <p>
            In case you haven’t heard of WebAssembly, this section is for you to
            help you understand why WebAssembly is truly the future and
            something to get excited about!
          </p>
          <p>
            WebAssembly is a binary instruction set that can be executed
            consistently and securely anywhere: meaning in the browser client
            and on the server almost any architecture and OS. It’s an amazing
            breakthrough that is already working on all the major browsers and
            all the major Os and architecture combinations. If you want to learn
            more about WebAssembly check it out on the WebAssembly.org website.
          </p>
          <p>
            One reason that WebAssembly is secure is that it is executed in a
            “host” environment, which also serves as its sandbox. WebAssembly
            cannot by itself access any files or connect to the network. A
            WebAssembly program cannot even create a thread and update itself
            automatically, it relies upon its host to provide it with data and
            execution time. The host also provides an interface for WebAssembly
            to call for additional custom interaction between the host and the
            WebAssembly guest.
          </p>
          <p>
            This brings us back to one of the original problems Starlane was
            created to solve: WebAssembly needs a standard way to interact with
            varied enterprise resources. And to that end the Mechtron was
            invented…
          </p>
          <h3 id="mechtrons">MECHTRONS</h3>
          <p>
            The Mechtron is an open source framework of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor model</a>.
            Starlane implements the host Mechtron interface and can communicate
            to any WebAssembly binary that was compiled with an implementation
            of the guest Mechtron interface.
          </p>
          <p>Additionally a Mechtron standard defines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A bind configuration which tells the Resource Mesh what kind of
              messages the Mechtron can receive and the schema of the expected
              message payloads
            </li>
            <li>
              A mechtron deployment configuration file which defines which
              WebAssembly binary artifact to execute and references a bind
              config artifact to implement as well as some additional custom
              parameters
            </li>
            <li>
              An application configuration which defines the mechtron
              initialization and composition of the app as well as some other
              required resources like FileSystems, Databases etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Importantly the WebAssembly binary can now use the Mechtron
            interface to access The Resource Mesh in order to access any
            Resource in the enterprise and talk to other Mechtrons in an agreed
            upon message payload serialization thanks to the bind references
          </p>
          <p>
            An Application that executes within Starlane’s Mesh can be composed
            of many multiple mechtrons that may be written by completely
            different people in completely different languages yet they will be
            able to communicate and coordinate with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            And… The Application can even swap out mechtrons while it is
            running…
          </p>
          <p>
            And… Tenants of a Starlane Cloud Service could be given permission
            to overwrite the default Mechtron that managed something specific to
            them: let’s say for example users of a social media site would like
            to write custom code to render their Profile page. They could create
            a custom mechtron that implements the profile bind referenced by the
            application and then deploy and let the social medias sites Starlane
            instance securely execute their custom code infrastructure!<br />
            Mechtrons are made to encourage creativity and collaboration through
            code! The possibilities are very exciting!

            Why not try out the
            <a href="http://starlane.io/docs/" title="Docs">Getting Started</a>
            guide today where you can deploy Starlane, publish some static files
            to an Artifact Bundle, serve those files from an http server and
            then deploy and create an actual Mechtron and serve an html page
            from that mechtron.
